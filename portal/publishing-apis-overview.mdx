## Introduction

Publishing APIs on the Tyk Developer Portal involves a specific sequence of configuration steps. Following this order ensures that each component is properly set up before the next one depends on it. This guide walks you through the complete API publishing lifecycle, from connecting your API infrastructure to managing developer access.

Understanding this workflow will help you avoid common configuration issues and create a smooth experience for both your team and your API consumers.

## The API Publishing Workflow

The publishing workflow follows a logical sequence where each step builds on the previous one:

1. **Configure API Providers** - Connect your Developer Portal to Tyk Dashboard instances
2. **Configure API Catalogs** - Create collections to organize how APIs are presented
3. **Configure API Products** - Package your APIs into consumable offerings
4. **Configure API Plans** - Define usage terms and access tiers
5. **Manage API Access** - Handle developer access and ongoing administration

<Note>
While you can technically create these resources in any order, following this sequence prevents dependency issues and ensures a coherent publishing strategy.
</Note>

## Step 1: Configure API Providers

Before you can publish any APIs, you must establish a connection between the Developer Portal and your Tyk Dashboard. This connection, called a **Provider**, is the foundation of your API publishing infrastructure.

A Provider enables the Developer Portal to:
- Discover APIs defined in your Tyk Dashboard
- Create access policies for API Products and Plans
- Issue credentials to developers when access is approved
- Synchronize configuration between the Portal and Dashboard

**What you need before starting:**
- A running Tyk Dashboard instance
- [API access credentials](/portal/api-provider#tyk-dashboard-api-access-credentials) for the Dashboard with the required permissions
- Network connectivity between the Portal and Dashboard

**Key configuration steps:**
1. Navigate to **Providers** in the Admin Portal
2. Select **Add Provider**
3. Configure the connection URL and authentication credentials
4. Set the policy tags to control which Dashboard policies are synchronized

For complete configuration details, see the [API Providers](/portal/api-provider) reference guide.

<Note>
You can connect multiple Providers to a single Developer Portal, enabling you to expose APIs from different environments (development, staging, production) or different organizational units.
</Note>

## Step 2: Configure API Catalogs

With your Provider connected, the next step is to create **Catalogs**. Catalogs determine how your API offerings are organized and who can see them. Think of Catalogs as curated storefronts for different audiences.

Creating Catalogs before Products and Plans allows you to:
- Plan your audience segmentation strategy upfront
- Assign Products and Plans to appropriate Catalogs as you create them
- Avoid having to reconfigure visibility settings later

**Consider your audiences:**
- Will you have public APIs available to everyone?
- Do you need private Catalogs for specific partners or teams?
- Should different developer segments see different API offerings?

**Key configuration steps:**
1. Navigate to **Catalogues** in the Admin Portal
2. Select **Add Catalogue**
3. Set the visibility (Public or Private)
4. For Private Catalogs, specify which Teams can access them

For complete configuration details, see the [API Catalogs](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-catalogues) reference guide.

## Step 3: Configure API Products

**API Products** are the core offerings you present to developers. A Product packages one or more APIs into a coherent unit with documentation, descriptions, and context that explains the business value.

Products should be created after Providers and Catalogs because:
- Products are created using APIs from a specific Provider
- Products are published to Catalogs for visibility

**Key decisions when creating Products:**
- Which APIs should be bundled together to solve a specific use case?
- What documentation will help developers understand and use the Product?
- Which Catalogs should display this Product?

**Key configuration steps:**
1. Navigate to **API Products** in the Admin Portal
2. Select **Add new API Product**
3. Choose the Provider and authentication method
4. Select the APIs to include
5. Add documentation, descriptions, and images
6. Assign the Product to one or more Catalogs

For complete configuration details, see the [API Products](/portal/api-products) reference guide.

<Note>
A Product can appear in multiple Catalogs, allowing you to expose the same offering to different audiences with potentially different Plans.
</Note>

## Step 4: Configure API Plans

**API Plans** define the terms under which developers can access your API Products. Plans establish rate limits, quotas, and approval requirements, enabling you to create tiered access levels.

Plans are created after Products because:
- Plans use the same Provider as the Products they will be associated with
- Plans are assigned to Catalogs alongside Products

**Common Plan configurations:**
- **Free tier**: Low limits, auto-approved access for exploration
- **Standard tier**: Moderate limits for production applications
- **Premium tier**: Higher limits, manual approval for enterprise customers

**Key configuration steps:**
1. Navigate to **Plans** in the Admin Portal
2. Select **Add Plan**
3. Choose the Provider
4. Configure rate limits and quotas
5. Set the key lifetime and approval settings
6. Assign the Plan to appropriate Catalogs

For complete configuration details, see the [API Plans](/portal/api-plans) reference guide.

<Note>
Ensure that Products and their relevant Plans are assigned to the same Catalogs. A developer can only request access using Plans that are visible in the same Catalog as the Product.
</Note>

## Step 5: Manage API Access and Users

With your Products and Plans published to Catalogs, developers can begin discovering and requesting access to your APIs. This final step covers ongoing administration tasks.

### Handling Access Requests

When a developer requests access to an API Product through a Plan, a **provisioning request** is created. Depending on your Plan configuration:
- **Auto-approved Plans**: Credentials are issued immediately
- **Manual approval Plans**: An API Owner must review and approve the request

To manage provisioning requests:
1. Navigate to **Provisioning requests** in the Admin Portal
2. Review pending requests
3. Approve or reject based on your criteria

For details on managing access requests, see [Approve Requests](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/api-access/approve-requests).

### Managing API Consumers

As your developer community grows, you may need to:
- Approve new user registrations
- Organize developers into Teams and Organisations
- Manage access to Private Catalogs
- Deactivate or remove users

For details on consumer management, see [API Consumers](/portal/api-consumer) and [Managing Organisations](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-api-consumer-organisations).

### Ongoing Administration

Regular administrative tasks include:
- Reviewing and updating Product documentation
- Adjusting Plan limits based on usage patterns
- Managing Catalog visibility as partnerships evolve
- Monitoring API usage and consumer activity

For details on API Owner responsibilities, see [API Owners](/portal/api-owner).

## Common Configuration Mistakes

Understanding the workflow helps avoid these frequent issues:

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Avoid |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Product not visible in Live Portal | Product not assigned to a Catalog | Ensure Products are assigned to at least one Catalog |
| Plan not available for a Product | Plan and Product in different Catalogs | Assign both to the same Catalog(s) |
| APIs not appearing when creating Products | Provider not synchronized | Trigger a manual sync or wait for automatic sync |
| Access credentials not working | APIs from different Providers in one Product | Each Product can only include APIs from one Provider |

## Summary

The API publishing workflow on the Tyk Developer Portal follows this sequence:

1. **Providers** establish the connection to your API management infrastructure
2. **Catalogs** organize your offerings for different audiences
3. **Products** package APIs into valuable, documented offerings
4. **Plans** define access terms and usage tiers
5. **Access Management** handles ongoing developer relationships

Following this workflow ensures each component is properly configured before dependent components are created, resulting in a coherent API publishing strategy and a smooth experience for your developer community.
