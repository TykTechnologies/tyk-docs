## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 20.10 or 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Developer Portal License**: [Contact our team](https://tyk.io/contact/) to obtain a license or get self-managed trial license by completing the registration on our [website](https://tyk.io/self-managed-trial/).

## Docker

This section explains how to install Tyk Developer Portal in a container using Docker.
Depending on your preferences, you can use MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL for the database.

In this recipe, the database and the portal container will run on the same network, with the database storing its data on a volume. The portal's CMS assets (images, files and themes) are stored in the database, although this guide provides links to the documentation to use a persistent volume or an S3 bucket as a storage medium for CMS assets.
Additionally, all settings for the Portal are configured using an env-file.


<Warning>
**Note**  

This document is just an example. Customize all fields, including the username, password, root password, database name and more.

Be sure to update the connection DSN in the env-file accordingly.
</Warning>

### Using PostgreSQL

1. **Create a network for the portal deployment**

    To start with, you need to create a Docker network for communication between the database and the portal. Execute the following command to create it:
    ```console
    docker network create tyk-portal
    ```

2. **Create an init script for PostgreSQL**

    To initialize a PostgreSQL database, you need to create an init script that will later be used to launch the PostgreSQL instance.
    Copy the content below to a file named `init.sql`, which you will need in the next step.
    ```sql
    -- init.sql
    -- Creating user
    CREATE USER admin WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secr3t';
    CREATE DATABASE portal;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE portal TO admin;
    ```

3. **Create the database volume and launch the database**

    The next step is to launch the PostgreSQL database for the portal. To achieve this, create a data volume for the database first:
    ```console
    docker volume create tyk-portal-postgres-data
    ```

    Then launch the PostgreSQL instance by executing the following command:
    ```container
    docker run \
    -d \
    --name tyk-portal-postgres \
    --restart on-failure:5 \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secr3t \
    -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    --mount type=volume,source=tyk-portal-postgres-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    --mount type=bind,src=$(pwd)/init.sql,dst=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql \
    --network tyk-portal \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:10-alpine
    ```
    **Note**

    
    <Warning>
    The above PostgreSQL configuration is an example. You can customize deployment of your PostgreSQL instance. Please refer to [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html) for further guidance.
    </Warning>


4. **Create an environment variables file**

    Creating an environment variables file to specify settings for the portal is the next step.
    This is optional, as you can alternatively specify all the variables using the -e option when starting your deployment.

    Here is an example of a sample environment file. For a comprehensive reference of environment variables, please refer to the [configuration section](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration) in the Tyk Developer Portal documentation.
    ```ini
    PORTAL_HOSTPORT=3001
    PORTAL_DATABASE_DIALECT=postgres
    PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTIONSTRING=host=tyk-portal-postgres port=5432 dbname=portal user=admin password=secr3t sslmode=disable
    PORTAL_DATABASE_ENABLELOGS=false
    PORTAL_THEMING_THEME=default
    PORTAL_STORAGE=db
    PORTAL_LICENSEKEY=<your-license-here>
    ```

    Once you have completed this step, you are ready to launch the portal application with PostgreSQL in a Docker container.

5. **Pull and launch the portal container**

    To pull and launch the portal using Docker, use the command provided below.
    Ensure that you replace `<tag>` with the specific version of the portal you intend to launch before executing the command, e.g. `tykio/portal:v1.7` for the portal v1.7. You can browse all available versions on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/portal/tags) and in the [release notes section](/developer-support/release-notes/portal#170-release-notes).
    ```console
    docker run -d \
        -p 3001:3001 \
        --env-file .env \
        --network tyk-portal \
        --name tyk-portal \
        tykio/portal:<tag>
    ```

    This command will launch the portal on localhost at port 3001. Now, you can bootstrap the portal and start managing your API products.

6. **Bootstrap the portal**

    Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it's the first time you are launching it.
    Follow the [bootstrapping section](#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.

7. **Clean up**

    If you want to clean up your environment or start the installation process from scratch, execute the following commands to stop and remove the portal container:
    ```console
    docker stop tyk-portal
    docker rm tyk-portal
    docker stop tyk-portal-postgres
    docker rm tyk-portal-postgres
    docker volume rm tyk-portal-postgres-data
    ```

### Using MySQL

1. **Create a network for the portal deployment**

    To start with, you need to create a Docker network for communication between the database and the portal. Execute the following command to create it:
    ```console
    docker network create tyk-portal
    ```

2. **Create the database volume and launch the database**

    The next step is to launch the MySQL database for the portal. To achieve this, create a data volume for the database first:
    ```console
    docker volume create tyk-portal-mysql-data
    ```

    Then launch the MySQL instance by executing the following command:
    ```console
    docker run \
    -d \
    --name tyk-portal-mysql \
    --restart on-failure:5 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sup3rsecr3t \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=portal \
    -e MYSQL_USER=admin \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secr3t \
    --mount type=volume,source=tyk-portal-mysql-data,target=/var/lib/mysql \
    --network tyk-portal \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    mysql:5.7 --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci --sql-mode=ALLOW_INVALID_DATES
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    **Note**  

    The above MySQL configuration is an example. You can customize deployment of your MySQL instance.

    Please refer to the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-applications.html) for further guidance.
    </Warning>


3. **Create an environment variables file**

    Creating an environment variables file to specify settings for the portal is the next step.
    This is optional, as you can alternatively specify all the variables using the -e option when starting your deployment.

    Here is an example of a sample environment file. For a comprehensive reference of environment variables, please refer to the [configuration](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration) section in the Tyk Developer Portal documentation.
    ```ini
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sup3rsecr3t
    MYSQL_DATABASE=portal
    MYSQL_USER=admin
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=secr3t
    PORTAL_HOSTPORT=3001
    PORTAL_DATABASE_DIALECT=mysql
    PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTIONSTRING=admin:secr3t@tcp(tyk-portal-mysql:3306)/portal?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=true
    PORTAL_DATABASE_ENABLELOGS=false
    PORTAL_THEMING_THEME=default
    PORTAL_STORAGE=db
    PORTAL_LICENSEKEY=<your-license-here>
    ```

    Once you have completed this step, you are ready to launch the portal application with MySQL in a Docker container or via Docker Compose.

4. **Pull and launch the portal container**

    To pull and launch the portal using Docker, use the command provided below.
    Ensure that you replace `<tag>` with the specific version of the portal you intend to launch before executing the command, e.g. `tykio/portal:v1.7` for the portal v1.7.
    You can browse all available versions on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/portal/tags) and in the [release notes](/developer-support/release-notes/portal#170-release-notes) section.

        -p 3001:3001 \
        --env-file .env \
        --network tyk-portal \
        --name tyk-portal \
        --mount type=bind,src=/tmp/portal/themes,dst=/opt/portal/themes \
        --mount type=bind,src=/tmp/portal/system,dst=/opt/portal/public/system \
        tykio/portal:<tag>
    ```

    This command will launch the portal on localhost at port 3001. Now, you can bootstrap the portal and start managing your API products.

5. **Bootstrap the portal**

    Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it's the first time you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping](#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) section of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.
