### Prerequisites

To successfully install the Tyk Developer Portal using RPM, your environment should satisfy the following requirements:
- Connectivity to [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io). If your environment doesn't have connectivity to packagecloud, you will need to download the portal package and copy it to the target host.
- RPM Package Manager should be installed on the host machine.

### Instructions

1. **Download the portal package**

    To start with, you need to download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io). To keep things organized, first create a directory where all installation assets (packages and config files) will be stored:
    ```console
    mkdir ~/portal-install
    cd ~/portal-install
    ```

    Next, download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal) by executing the command below.
    
    Ensure to replace `distro-type`, `distro-version` and `package-version` with actual values e.g. https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal/packages/ubuntu/noble/portal_1.16.0_amd64.deb/download.deb?distro_version_id=284 for the portal v1.16.0 for Ubuntu 24.04 (noble) amd64.
    ```console
    wget --content-disposition "https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal/packages/<distro-type>/<distro-version>/portal_<package-version>_1.x86_64.rpm/download.rpm?distro_version_id=284"
    ```

2. **Install the portal package**

    Once the package is downloaded, you need to install using RPM. Execute the below command to so. Once again, ensure to replace `portal-1.16.0-1.x86_64.rpm` with an actual filename of the package you have downloaded on the previous step.  
    ```console
    sudo rpm -i portal-1.16.0-1.x86_64.rpm
    ```

3. **Update the configuration file with your license**

    Before starting the portal service, you need to configure the portal. Once the rpm package has been installed, the portal configuration file will be located in `/opt/portal/portal.conf`.
    Initially, the config file is filled with the default values. The minimal configuration change to start the portal is to add the `LicenseKey` property to the config file.
    The below sample configuration will start the portal on portal 3001 with PostgreSQL as a database, no TLS enabled, and all CMS assets (images, theme files, etc.) are stored in the filesystem.
    You can, however, customize the provided example and make more suitable for your need using the [configuration](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration) reference.
    ```json
    {
    "HostPort": 3001,
    "LicenseKey": "<your-license-here>",
    "Database": {
        "Dialect": "postgres",
        "ConnectionString": "host=tyk-portal-postgres port=5432 dbname=portal user=admin password=secr3t sslmode=disable",
        "EnableLogs": false
    },
    "Blog": {
        "Enable": true
    },
    "Site": {
        "Enable": true
    },
    "Forms": {
        "Enable": false
    },
    "StoreSessionName": "portal-store-session-name",
    "PortalAPISecret": "123456",
    "Storage": "fs",
    "S3": {
        "AccessKey": "your-access-key-here",
        "SecretKey": "your-secret-key-here",
        "Region": "s3-region",
        "Endpoint": "if-any",
        "Bucket": "your-bucket-here",
        "ACL": "",
        "PresignURLs": true
    },
    "TLSConfig": {
        "Enable": false,
        "InsecureSkipVerify": false,
        "Certificates":[
        {
            "Name": "localhost",
            "CertFile": "portal.crt",
            "KeyFile": "portal.key"
        }
        ]
    }
    }
    ```

4. **Start the portal service**

    Now when the portal package is installed and the configuration is updated, it is time to start the portal by executing the following command:
    ```console
    sudo systemctl start portal.service
    ```

    To check status and log of the portal execute the following command:
    ```console
    systemctl status portal.service
    ```

5. **Bootstrap the portal**

    Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it's the first you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping](#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) section of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.

## Ubuntu / Debian

This guide provides a step-by-step recipe for launching the Tyk Developer Portal using a DEB package in Ubuntu / Debian environment.

### Prerequisites

To successfully install the Tyk Developer Portal using DEB, your environment should satisfy the following requirements:
- Connectivity to [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io). If your environment doesn't have
connectivity to packagecloud, you will need to download the portal package and copy it to the target host.
- Debian Package Manager should be installed on the host machine.

### Instructions

1. **Download the portal package**

    To start with, you need to download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io). To keep things organized, first create a directory where all installation assets (packages and config files) will be stored:

    Next, download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal) by executing the command below.
    
    Ensure to replace `distro-type`, `distro-version` and `package-version` with actual values e.g. https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal/packages/ubuntu/noble/portal_1.16.0_amd64.deb/download.deb?distro_version_id=284 for the portal v1.16.0 for Ubuntu 24.04 (noble) amd64.
    ```console
    wget --content-disposition "https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal/packages/<distro-type>/<distro-version>/portal_<package-version>_amd64.deb/download.deb?distro_version_id=284"
    ```
2. **Install the portal package**

    Once the package is downloaded, you need to install using DEB. Execute the below command to so. Once again, ensure to replace `portal_1.16.0_amd64.deb` with an actual filename of the package you have downloaded on the previous step.  
    ```console
    sudo dpkg -i portal_1.16.0_amd64.deb
