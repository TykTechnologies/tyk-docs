## Linux (RPM)
<a id="linux-rpm"></a>

Install the portal on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Stream, or compatible distributions using RPM packages.

<Warning>
**Operating System Requirements**

Portal v1.16.0 and later requires GLIBC 2.34+. This means:
- RHEL 9 or later is required
- CentOS Stream 9 or later is required
- RHEL 8 and CentOS 8 are NOT supported
</Warning>

**Prerequisites**
- RHEL 9, CentOS Stream 9, or compatible distribution
- Network connectivity to [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io) (or download packages manually)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the portal package**

    Create an installation directory and download the package:
    ```console
    mkdir ~/portal-install
    cd ~/portal-install
    ```

    Download from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable). Replace `<version>` with the desired version:
    ```console
    wget --content-disposition "https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable/packages/el/9/portal-<version>.x86_64.rpm/download.rpm"
    ```

2. **Install the package**

    ```console
    sudo rpm -i portal-<version>.x86_64.rpm
    ```

3. **Configure the portal**

    Edit the configuration file at `/opt/portal/portal.conf`:
    ```json
    {
      "HostPort": 3001,
      "LicenseKey": "<your-license-here>",
      "Database": {
        "Dialect": "postgres",
        "ConnectionString": "host=localhost port=5432 dbname=portal user=admin password=secr3t sslmode=disable",
        "EnableLogs": false
      },
      "Storage": "fs",
      "TLSConfig": {
        "Enable": false
      }
    }
    ```

    See the [configuration reference](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration) for all options.

4. **Start the portal service**

    ```console
    sudo systemctl start portal.service
    ```

    Check the status:
    ```console
    systemctl status portal.service
    ```

5. **Bootstrap the portal**

    The portal is now running on port 3001. Complete the [bootstrapping process](#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) to create the super admin user.

## Prerequisites

- **Portal License**: [Contact our team](https://tyk.io/contact/) to obtain a license or get self-managed trial license by completing the registration on our [website](https://tyk.io/self-managed-trial/).

## System Requirements

Before installing the portal, ensure your environment meets the following requirements.

### Operating System Requirements

<Warning>
**Important: GLIBC Compatibility**

Starting with Portal v1.16.0, the portal binary requires GLIBC 2.34 or later. This means:
- **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) or later** is required
- **Ubuntu 20.04 is NOT supported** - it ships with GLIBC 2.31
- **RHEL/CentOS 9** or later is required
- **Debian 12 (Bookworm)** or later is required

If you attempt to run Portal v1.16.0+ on an older OS, you will encounter errors like:
```
/opt/portal/dev-portal: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found
```

**Solution:** Upgrade your host OS to a supported version or use the Docker installation method.
</Warning>

### Supported Operating Systems

| Operating System | Version | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| Ubuntu | 22.04 (Jammy) or later | Recommended for Linux installations |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 9 or later | For RPM-based installations |
| CentOS Stream | 9 or later | For RPM-based installations |
| Debian | 12 (Bookworm) or later | - |
| Docker | Any host with Docker 20.10+ | Recommended installation method |
| Kubernetes | 1.19+ with Helm 3+ | For containerized deployments |

### Database Requirements

The portal requires a database to store metadata. Supported databases:

- **PostgreSQL** 12 or later (recommended)
- **MySQL** 8.0 or later
- **MariaDB** 10.6 or later

<Note>
**Note: SQLite support**

Tyk Developer Portal no longer supports SQLite as of version 1.14.0. Please use PostgreSQL or another supported database.
</Note>

### Red Hat (RHEL / CentOS)
<a id="linux-redhat-centos"></a>

This guide provides a step-by-step recipe for launching the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal using an RPM package in Red Hat environment (RHEL / CentOS).


<Warning>
**Note**

This document is just an example. Customize all fields, including the username, password, root password, database name and more.

Be sure to update the connection DSN in the env-file accordingly.
</Warning>


**Prerequisites**

To successfully install the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal using RPM, your environment should satisfy the following requirements:
- Connectivity to [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io). If your environment doesn't have connectivity to packagecloud, you will need to download the portal package and copy it to the target host.
- RPM Package Manager should be installed on the host machine.

**Steps for Installation**

1. **Download the portal package**

    To start with, you need to download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io). To keep things organized, first create a directory where all installation assets (packages and config files) will be stored:
    ```console
    mkdir ~/portal-install
    cd ~/portal-install
    ```

    Next, download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable) by executing the command below.
    Ensure to replace package-version with actual package version e.g. https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable/packages/el/8/portal-1.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm/download.rpm?distro_version_id=205 for the portal v1.7.0 for x86_64.
    ```console
    wget --content-disposition "https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable/packages/<package-version>"
    ```

2. **Install the portal package**

    Once the package is downloaded, you need to install using RPM. Execute the below command to so. Once again, ensure to replace `portal-1.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm` with an actual filename of the package you have downloaded on the previous step.  
    ```console
    sudo rpm -i portal-1.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm
    ```

3. **Update the configuration file with your license**

    Before starting the portal service, you need to configure the portal. Once the rpm package has been installed, the portal configuration file will be located in `/opt/portal/portal.conf`.
    Initially, the config file is filled with the default values. The minimal configuration change to start the portal is to add the `LicenseKey` property to the config file.
    The below sample configuration will start the portal on portal 3001 with PostgreSQL as a database, no TLS enabled, and all CMS assets (images, theme files, etc.) are stored in the filesystem.
    You can, however, customize the provided example and make more suitable for your need using the [configuration](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration) reference.
    ```json
    {
    "HostPort": 3001,
    "LicenseKey": "<your-license-here>",
    "Database": {
        "Dialect": "postgres",
        "ConnectionString": "host=tyk-portal-postgres port=5432 dbname=portal user=admin password=secr3t sslmode=disable",
        "EnableLogs": false
    },
    "Blog": {
        "Enable": true
    },
    "Site": {
        "Enable": true
    },
    "Forms": {
        "Enable": false
    },
    "StoreSessionName": "portal-store-session-name",
    "PortalAPISecret": "123456",
    "Storage": "fs",
    "S3": {
        "AccessKey": "your-access-key-here",
        "SecretKey": "your-secret-key-here",
        "Region": "s3-region",
        "Endpoint": "if-any",
        "Bucket": "your-bucket-here",
        "ACL": "",
        "PresignURLs": true
    },
    "TLSConfig": {
        "Enable": false,
        "InsecureSkipVerify": false,
        "Certificates":[
        {
            "Name": "localhost",
            "CertFile": "portal.crt",
            "KeyFile": "portal.key"
        }
        ]
    }
    }
    ```

4. **Start the portal service**

    Now when the portal package is installed and the configuration is updated, it is time to start the portal by executing the following command:
    ```console
    sudo systemctl start portal.service
    ```

    To check status and log of the portal execute the following command:
    ```console
    systemctl status portal.service
    ```

5. **Bootstrap the portal**

    Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it's the first you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping](#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) section of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.
