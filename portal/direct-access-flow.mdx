## Availability

| Component   | Version              | Editions                |
| :------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Developer Portal | Available since [v1.16.0](/developer-support/release-notes/portal#1-16-0-release-notes) | Enterprise |

## Prerequisites

1. **Dashboard License**: [Contact our team](https://tyk.io/contact/) to obtain a license or get self-managed trial license by completing the registration on our [website](https://tyk.io/self-managed-trial/).
2. **Working Tyk Environment:** You need access to a running Tyk instance. For setup instructions using Docker, please refer to the [Tyk Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/quick-start).
3. Developer Portal Setup with
    1. Admin access to the Tyk Developer Portal.
    2. The end user (developer accounts) must exist in the portal.
    3. Tyk Developer Portal v1.16.0 or later.
    4. [API Products](/portal/api-products), [Plans](/portal/api-plans) and [Catalogue](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-catalogues) already created and published in the portal.

## What we will do

1. Enable the Direct Access flow in the Admin Portal settings.
2. Request access to an [API Product](/portal/api-products) as a developer and create a new [application](/portal/developer-app).
3. Add more products to an existing application by reusing credentials.
4. Change the [Plan](/portal/api-plans) for an existing credential.
5. Handle scenarios where different plans require separate credentials within the same app.
6. Configure and manage access as an admin on behalf of developers.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to configure and use the Direct Access flow in the Tyk Developer Portal:

### 1. Enable Direct Access Flow (Admin)

1. Log in to the **Admin Portal** as an administrator.
2. In the main navigation, go to **Settings**.
3. Select **General** from the settings menu.
4. Locate the **API product access flow** setting.
    - By default, this is set to **Cart-based flow**.
5. Switch the option from **Cart-based flow** to **Direct access flow**.
6. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

<Note>
Once enabled, all API consumers will experience the streamlined Direct Access flow when requesting access to API products from the Live Portal. The shopping cart step is completely removed.
</Note>

### 2. Request Access to an API Product (Developer)

When the Direct Access flow is enabled, developers can request access to an API product without going through a shopping cart:

1. Log in to the **Developer Portal** as an API Consumer.
2. In the main navigation, go to **Catalogues**.
3. Browse the API Catalog and click on an API product you want to access.
4. Review the available plans and their rate limits/quotas.
5. Select the **Plan** you want to use.
6. Click **Request access**.
    - Notice there is no shopping cart step - you go directly to the access request page.
7. In the access request form:
    - Enter an **Application name** (e.g., `My Weather App`).
    - Optionally add a **Description** for the application.
    - Configure **Visibility settings** (Personal or Organization-wide).
8. Click **Submit request**.

<Note>
If the plan is configured for auto-approval, credentials will be issued immediately. Otherwise, an API Owner will review and approve your request.
</Note>

#### View Your Credentials

After approval:

1. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select **My Dashboard** from the dropdown.
2. Go to **My Apps** in the left navigation.
3. Click on your application.
4. In the **API Credentials** section, you will see your access credentials.
    - Click **Show** to reveal the API key.
    - Copy the credentials for use in your API requests.

### 3. Add More Products Using an Existing Credential

Once you have an application with approved access to at least one API product, you can add access to additional products using your existing credential:

1. Log in to the **Developer Portal** as an API Consumer.
2. Navigate to **Catalogues** and select another API product.
3. Select the **same plan** that your existing credential uses (e.g., if your existing credential uses "Gold", select "Gold" for the new product).
4. Click **Request access**.
5. On the access request page, you will see the option to **use an existing credential**.
6. Select your existing **Application** from the dropdown.
7. Choose the existing **Credential** that uses the matching plan.
8. Click **Submit request**.

<Note>
**Key benefit**: Your existing credential will now provide access to both API products. You don't need to manage multiple API keys when using the same plan across multiple products.
</Note>

### 4. Change the Plan for an Existing Credential

Developers can upgrade or downgrade their plan for existing product access:

1. Log in to the **Developer Portal** and navigate to **My Dashboard**.
2. Go to **My Apps** and click on the relevant application.
3. Find the credential you want to modify.
4. Click **Change plan** (or the equivalent option).
5. Choose your new plan from the available options (e.g., upgrade from Gold to Platinum).
6. Submit the plan change request.

<Warning>
**Important behavior for plan changes:**
- A plan change creates a new access request that requires approval (unless the new plan is configured for auto-approval).
- Your current access remains active on the existing plan until the new plan is approved.
- If your credential provides access to multiple API products, changing the plan will affect access to **all products** on that credential.
</Warning>

### 5. Handle Different Plans Within the Same Application

When you want to add an API product using a **different plan** than your existing credentials:

1. Log in to the **Developer Portal** and navigate to **Catalogues**.
2. Select an API product.
3. Select a **different plan** than your existing credentials use (e.g., if your existing credential uses "Gold" but you want "Bronze" for this product).
4. Click **Request access**.
5. On the access request page, you will **not** see the option to reuse your existing credential.
6. The system will require you to **create a new credential** for this plan:
    - Enter a **Name** for the new credential.
    - Complete the access request form.
7. Click **Submit request**.

<Note>
**Why a new credential is required**: A single credential can only be associated with ONE API plan. This ensures consistent rate limiting and quota enforcement across all products accessed through that credential.
</Note>

#### Credential Compatibility Reference

| Scenario | Can Reuse Existing Credential? | Action Required |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Same plan as existing credential | Yes | Select existing credential |
| Different plan than existing credential | No | Create new credential |

### 6. Configure Access as an Admin

Portal administrators can perform similar operations on behalf of developers from the Admin Portal:

#### Create Applications for Developers

1. Log in to the **Admin Portal** as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **API Consumers > Applications**.
3. Click **Add new application**.
4. Enter the application details:
    - **Application name**
    - **Description**
    - Select the **Developer (API Consumer)** who will own the application.
    - Configure **Visibility settings**.
5. Click **Save**.

#### Add Credentials and Products

1. Navigate to the application details page.
2. Click **Add credential**.
3. Choose the **API Product** and **Plan** to associate with the credential.
4. The credential will be generated and associated with the selected product/plan.
5. Additional products on the same plan can be added to this credential.

#### Approve Access Requests

1. Navigate to **Access Requests** in the Admin Portal.
2. Review pending requests from developers.
3. Click **Approve** or **Reject** for each request.
4. Approved requests will generate credentials for the developer.

### 7. Revert to Cart-based Flow (Optional)

The Direct Access flow is optional. Administrators can switch back to the traditional cart-based flow at any time:

1. Log in to the **Admin Portal** as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Settings > General**.
3. Change the **API product access flow** setting back to **Cart-based flow**.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

<Note>
**When to use cart-based flow**: The cart-based flow is better suited for monetized API models where checkout/payment integration is needed, or scenarios where developers typically request access to multiple products simultaneously.
</Note>
