## Introduction

The Tyk Developer Portal offers two access flows for API consumers to request access to API products:

- **Cart-based flow** (default): The traditional shopping cart experience where developers add products to a cart, proceed to checkout, and then submit their access request. This flow is optimized for monetized API models.

- **Direct Access flow**: A streamlined experience that removes the shopping cart entirely. Developers can select an API product and plan, then immediately request access in just a few clicks.

The Direct Access flow was introduced in Tyk Portal version 1.16 to reduce friction for indirect monetization scenarios. By removing the shopping cart step, the access request journey becomes shorter and more straightforward, improving the developer experience based on feedback from enterprise clients.

## Availability

| Component | Version | Editions |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Tyk Developer Portal | v1.16+ | Enterprise |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Installed](/portal/install) the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal
- [Connected](/portal/overview/getting-started#configuring-the-provider) to a Provider (Tyk Dashboard)
- [Configured](/portal/overview/getting-started#create-an-organizational-structure) at least one Organisation and Team
- [Published](/portal/publish-api-catalog) an API Catalog with at least one API Product and Plan
- Administrator access to enable the Direct Access flow (for the admin portions of this guide)
- An API Consumer account to experience the developer flow

## What we will do

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. **Enable the Direct Access flow** - Configure the portal settings to switch from the cart-based flow to the streamlined direct access flow
2. **Request access to an API product** - Experience the simplified workflow where developers can request access in just a few clicks
3. **Add more products using existing credentials** - Learn how to attach additional API products to an existing application
4. **Understand credential and plan compatibility** - Understand when you can reuse credentials and when you need to create new ones
5. **Manage and change API plans** - Upgrade or downgrade plans for existing product access
6. **Perform admin operations** - Create apps and manage access on behalf of developers
7. **Switch back to cart-based flow** - Learn how to revert to the traditional shopping cart experience

## Step 1: Enable Direct Access Flow

Portal administrators can enable the Direct Access flow through the admin portal settings:

1. Log in to the Admin Portal as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the main navigation
3. Select **General** from the settings menu
4. Locate the **API product access flow** setting
   - By default, this is set to **Cart-based flow**
5. Switch the option from **Cart-based flow** to **Direct access flow**
6. Select **Save** to apply the changes

Once enabled, all API consumers will experience the streamlined Direct Access flow when requesting access to API products from the Live Portal.

## Step 2: Request Access to Your First Product (Developer Experience)

When the Direct Access flow is enabled, developers can request access to an API product with minimal steps:

1. Open the Developer Portal's public URL and log in as an API Consumer
2. Navigate to **Catalogues** in the main navigation
3. Browse the API Catalog and select an API product you want to access
4. Review the available plans and their rate limits/quotas
5. Select **Request access** (or the equivalent button based on your portal theme)
6. You will be taken directly to the access request page - notice there is no shopping cart step
7. Enter an **Application name** for your new application (e.g., "My Weather App")
   - Optionally add a description for the application
   - Configure visibility settings (Personal or Organization-wide)
8. Select **Submit request**

Your access request will be submitted. If the plan is configured for auto-approval, credentials will be issued immediately. Otherwise, an API Owner will review and approve your request.

### View Your Credentials

After approval:

1. Navigate to **My Dashboard** from the user menu
2. Go to **My Apps** in the left navigation
3. Select your application
4. In the **API Credentials** section, you'll see your access credentials
   - Click **Show** to reveal the API key
   - Copy the credentials for use in your API requests

## Step 3: Add More Products to an Existing Application

Once you have an application with approved access to at least one API product, you can add access to additional products. The process differs based on whether you select the same plan or a different plan.

### Scenario A: Adding a Product with the Same Plan

When you want to add another API product using the **same plan** as your existing credentials:

1. Browse the API Catalog and select another API product
2. Select the **same plan** that your existing credential uses (e.g., if your existing credential uses "Platinum", select "Platinum" for the new product)
3. Select **Request access**
4. On the access request page, you will see the option to **use an existing credential**
5. Select your existing application from the dropdown
6. Choose the existing credential that uses the matching plan
7. Select **Submit request**

**Key benefit**: Your existing credential will now provide access to both API products. You don't need to manage multiple API keys.

### Scenario B: Adding a Product with a Different Plan

When you want to add an API product using a **different plan**:

1. Browse the API Catalog and select an API product
2. Select a **different plan** than your existing credentials use (e.g., if your existing credential uses "Platinum" but you want "Bronze" for this product)
3. Select **Request access**
4. On the access request page, you will **not** see the option to reuse your existing credential
5. The system will require you to **create a new credential** for this plan
6. Enter a name for the new credential
7. Select **Submit request**

**Why a new credential is required**: A single credential can only be associated with ONE API plan. This ensures consistent rate limiting and quota enforcement across all products accessed through that credential.

### Understanding Credential Compatibility

| Scenario | Can Reuse Existing Credential? | Action Required |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Same plan as existing credential | Yes | Select existing credential |
| Different plan than existing credential | No | Create new credential |

**Example**:
- You have a credential providing access to Weather API on the **Gold** plan
- You want to add Maps API on the **Gold** plan → Use existing credential
- You want to add Notifications API on the **Bronze** plan → Create new credential

## Step 4: Change Plans for Existing Access

Developers can upgrade or downgrade their plan for existing product access:

1. Navigate to **My Dashboard** from the user menu
2. Go to **My Apps** and select the relevant application
3. Find the credential you want to modify
4. Select **Change plan** or the equivalent option
5. Choose your new plan from the available options (e.g., upgrade from Gold to Platinum)
6. Submit the plan change request

### Important Behavior for Plan Changes

- **New pending request**: A plan change creates a new access request that requires approval (unless the new plan is configured for auto-approval)
- **Existing access preserved**: Your current access remains active on the existing plan until the new plan is approved
- **Affects all products on the credential**: If your credential provides access to multiple API products, changing the plan will affect access to **all products** on that credential
- **Uninterrupted service**: This design ensures you maintain API access during the plan change process

### Handling Plan Change Rejections

If your plan change request is rejected:
- Your existing access remains unchanged
- You continue to use the original plan
- You can submit a new plan change request if needed
- Contact your API Owner or portal administrator for clarification on the rejection reason

## Step 5: Administrator Operations

Portal administrators can perform similar operations on behalf of developers from the Admin Portal:

### Creating Applications for Developers

1. Log in to the Admin Portal as an administrator
2. Navigate to **API Consumers > Applications**
3. Select **Add new application**
4. Enter the application details:
   - Application name
   - Description
   - Select the developer (API Consumer) who will own the application
   - Configure visibility settings
5. Select **Save**

### Adding Credentials and Products

1. Navigate to the application details page
2. Select **Add credential**
3. Choose the API Product and Plan to associate with the credential
4. The credential will be generated and associated with the selected product/plan
5. Additional products on the same plan can be added to this credential

### Approving Access Requests

1. Navigate to **Access Requests** in the Admin Portal
2. Review pending requests from developers
3. Select **Approve** or **Reject** for each request
4. Approved requests will generate credentials for the developer

## Step 6: Revert to Cart-based Flow

The Direct Access flow is optional. Administrators can switch back to the traditional cart-based flow at any time:

1. Log in to the Admin Portal as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Settings > General**
3. Change the **API product access flow** setting back to **Cart-based flow**
4. Select **Save** to apply the changes

### Developer Experience with Cart-based Flow

When the cart-based flow is enabled:

1. Developers browse the API Catalog and select a product
2. They select **Add to cart** for their chosen plan
3. They can add multiple products to the cart
4. They navigate to the shopping cart to review their selections
5. They proceed to checkout and submit the access request
6. All products in the cart are requested in a single submission

**When to use cart-based flow**:
- Monetized API models where checkout/payment integration is needed
- Scenarios where developers typically request access to multiple products simultaneously
- E-commerce style developer portals

## Comparison: Cart-based vs Direct Access Flow

| Aspect | Cart-based Flow | Direct Access Flow |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Shopping cart | Yes | No |
| Steps to request access | More (add to cart → checkout → submit) | Fewer (select plan → submit) |
| Best for | Monetized APIs, complex subscriptions | Indirect monetization, streamlined onboarding |
| Multiple products at once | Yes (via cart) | One product per request |
| User experience | E-commerce style | Streamlined, minimal friction |
| Credential reuse | Via cart/checkout | Direct selection during request |

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Reuse Existing Credential

If you cannot select an existing credential when requesting access:
- **Plan mismatch**: Verify the credential's associated plan matches your selected plan
- **Ownership**: Check that the credential belongs to an application you own
- **Application status**: Ensure the application is not in a pending or suspended state

### Plan Change Not Reflected

If your plan change doesn't appear to take effect:
- **Pending approval**: Check if the plan change request is still pending approval
- **Review status**: Contact your API Owner or portal administrator to review the request status
- **Current access active**: Remember that your current access remains active until the new plan is approved

### Access Request Stuck in Pending

If your access request remains pending:
- **Manual approval required**: Verify the plan is not configured for manual approval
- **Contact admin**: Contact your API Owner or organization administrator
- **Organizational policies**: Check if there are any organizational policies affecting automatic approvals

### Credential Shows Multiple Products

This is expected behavior. When you reuse an existing credential to access additional products on the same plan, all products will be listed under that single credential. This allows you to use one API key for multiple products.

## Best Practices

- **Plan your credential strategy**: Group API products that you need to access together under the same plan when possible
- **Consistent plans**: If you need to access multiple APIs together, choose the same plan for all of them to use a single credential
- **Separate applications**: Create separate applications for products that require fundamentally different access patterns or plans
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of rate limits and quotas across all products accessed through each credential
- **Name clearly**: Use descriptive names for applications and credentials to easily identify their purpose
