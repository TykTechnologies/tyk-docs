## Introduction

API Catalogs are curated collections of API Products and Plans that enable you to organize and present your API offerings to different developer audiences. Catalogs serve as the primary navigation and discovery mechanism in the Tyk Developer Portal, allowing you to create tailored API marketplaces for different consumer segments.

Unlike traditional API documentation sites that present all APIs to everyone, Catalogs give you fine-grained control over who sees what. This enables you to create personalized experiences for different developer audiences - from public APIs available to anyone, to specialized offerings for specific partners or internal teams.

Catalogs transform your API portfolio management by:

- Segmenting API Products for different developer audiences
- Creating customized discovery experiences for different use cases
- Controlling visibility of API offerings based on business relationships
- Enabling consistent organization of related API Products

In the Tyk Developer Portal, Catalogs act as the bridge between your API Products and your developer community, ensuring that each developer sees exactly the APIs they need.

## Key Concepts

### Catalog Types

The Tyk Developer Portal supports two visibility modes for Catalogs:

- Public Catalogs: Visible to anyone visiting your Developer Portal, even without logging in. Ideal for openly available APIs and developer recruitment.
- Private Catalogs: Visible only to authenticated users who have logged into your Developer Portal. They can be further restricted only to members of specific [teams](/nightly/portal/api-consumer). Perfect for partner-specific APIs, internal teams, or premium offerings.

### Catalog Structure

Each Catalog contains:

- [API Products](/nightly/portal/api-products): The functional API offerings available in this Catalog
- [Plans](/nightly/portal/api-plans): The subscription options available for Products in this Catalog
- Visibility Settings: Controls which developers can see this Catalog
- Presentation Elements: Name, description, and other display properties

### Catalog Relationships

Understanding how Catalogs relate to other elements in the Developer Portal:

- Products and Plans: A Product or Plan can appear in multiple Catalogs
- Teams and Organisations: Can be granted access to specific Custom Catalogs
- Developer Experience: Developers only see Catalogs they have access to
