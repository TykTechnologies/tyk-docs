    ## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

    The Tyk Dashboard API offers granular, programmatic access to a centralised database of resources that your Tyk nodes can pull from. This API has a dynamic user administrative structure which means the secret key that is used to communicate with your Tyk nodes can be kept secret and access to the wider management functions can be handled on a user-by-user and organisation-by-organisation basis.

    A common question around using a database-backed configuration is how to programmatically add API definitions to your Tyk nodes, the Dashboard API allows much more fine-grained, secure and multi-user access to your Tyk cluster, and should be used to manage a database-backed Tyk node.

    The Tyk Dashboard API works seamlessly with the Tyk Dashboard (and the two come bundled together).

    ## <a name="security-hierarchy"></a> Security Hierarchy

    The Dashboard API provides a more structured security layer to managing Tyk nodes.

    ### Organisations, APIs and Users

    With the Dashboard API and a database-backed Tyk setup, (and to an extent with file-based API setups - if diligence is used in naming and creating definitions), the following security model is applied to the management of Upstream APIs:

    * **Organisations**: All APIs are *owned* by an organisation, this is designated by the 'OrgID' parameter in the API Definition.
    * **Users**: All users created in the Dashboard belong to an organisation (unless an exception is made for super-administrative access).
    * **APIs**: All APIs belong to an Organisation and only Users that belong to that organisation can see the analytics for those APIs and manage their configurations.
    * **API Keys**: API Keys are designated by organisation, this means an API key that has full access rights will not be allowed to access the APIs of another organisation on the same system, but can have full access to all APIs within the organisation.
    * **Access Rights**: Access rights are stored with the key, this enables a key to give access to multiple APIs, this is defined by the session object in the core Tyk API.

    In order to use the Dashboard API, you'll need to get the 'Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials' secret from your user profile on the Dashboard UI.

    The secret you set should then be sent along as a header with each Dashboard API Request in order for it to be successful:

    An API template is an asset managed by Tyk Dashboard that is used as the starting point - a blueprint - from which you can create a new Tyk OAS API definition. <br/>

    Templates are used only during the creation of an API, they cannot be applied later.

    The Tyk Dashboard permission system can be extended by writing custom rules using an Open Policy Agent (OPA). The rules engine works on top of your Dashboard API, which means you can control not only access rules, but also behaviour of all Dashboard APIs (except your public developer portal)  <br/>

    By default the Dashboard OPA engine is turned off, and you need to explicitly enable it via your Dashboard tyk_analytics.conf file. <br/>

    You can use OPA rule to accomplish tasks like: <br/>

    1. Prevent users from creating keyless APIs.
    2. Assign specific categories to APIs created to certain user groups or users.
    3. Control access for individual fields. For example, do not allow changing the API “active” status (e.g. deploy), unless you have a specific permission set.
    4. And many more <br/>

    These APIs helps you get,add and delete (CRUD) a list of additional (custom) permissions for your Dashboard users. You can use the created additional permissions with Open Policy Agent (OPA). <br/>

     Once created, a custom permission will be added to standard list of user permissions. <br/>

    You can also configure these custom permissions in the security.additional_permissions map in the Tyk Dashboard configuration file.

    Webhooks are a great way to let external applications know about the status of a user, an API or an event that has occurred in the Tyk gateway <br/>

    You can create webhooks that you can then re-use in your API definitions and assign to different Tyk Events such as quota violations or rate-limiting violations.<br/>

    Each webhook require a target_path (which is an absolute URL that should be targeted by the webhook e.g https://httpbin.org/expired-keys) and a method which can be any of GET, PUT, POST, PATCH or DELETE.<br/>

    Request types that do not support an encoded body will not have the event metadata encoded as part of the request. We would advise using POST where possible.

- description: Policies are a template that enable you to create access rules, usage
    quota and rate limits that can be applied to multiple keys. They are a useful
    way to manage large groups of users, and to enforce quota changes on a global
    scale across any number of keys that are using a policy. When used in conjunction
    with the portal, developers that enroll for API access will be given a key that
    is attached to a specific policy. The policy settings are refreshed every time
    a key attempts access, meaning that updating a policy will have an effect across
    any keys that are attached to it.

        Create an API Definition in Tyk Classic API format.
          Note that the response includes the newly created Tyk Classic API Definition containing the unique identifier for the APIs (`api_id`). You can provide a value for the `api_id` in the request body, otherwise Tyk will automatically generate a value for you.
            The `ID` field within the Tyk Classic API Definition is a proprietary field used by Tyk to identify the API within the database and cannot be chosen or modified by the user.

          With this option you are able to filter by certificates that can be used when signing a request (i.e. they contain a private key),
          or those used to validate a signature (i.e. they do not contain a private key, only the public key).
          This query param works only in combination with detailed mode (mode=detailed). 
          `omit` (default) – Returns all certificates.
          with_pk – Returns only certificates that include a private key.
          without_pk – Returns only certificates that do not include a private key.

            This parameter filters audit logs based on partially matching the accessed API endpoint's URL path. It allows searching for actions performed on related resources or sections of the API by matching any portion of the URL. The match is case-sensitive and ignores additional path segments or query parameters beyond the matched portion.  
            For example, if the database contains URLs like `/tib/create`, `/tib/get/1?schema=json`,  `/api/schema`, and `/schema1` searching with `url=schema` would return  `/api/schema` and `/schema1`.
          example: /api/apis
