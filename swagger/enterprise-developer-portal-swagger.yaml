            Okta's authorization servers, including whether it operates as a
            web, native, single-page, or service application. This setting is
            required to register Okta Identity Providers and not required for
            other Identity Provider. Please note that Okta overwrites values of
            the `TokenEndpointAuthMethod`, `GrantType`, and `ResponseTypes`
            properties and fills them based on the value of the `OktaAppType`
            property.
