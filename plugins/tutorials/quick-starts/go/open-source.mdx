This quick start guide will explain how to run the [getting started](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-go-plugin) Go plugin using the Tyk OSS Gateway.

**Estimated time**: 10-15 minutes

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

1. Bootstrap the getting started example.
2. Test the plugin.
3. View the analytics.
4. Next steps.

## 1. Bootstrap the getting started example

Please run the following command from within your newly cloned directory to run the Tyk Stack and compile the sample plugin.  This will take a few minutes as we have to download all the necessary dependencies and docker images.

```bash
make up-oss && make build
```

## 2. Test the plugin

Let's test the plugin by sending an API request to the pre-configured API definition:

```
curl localhost:8080/httpbin/get
```

Response:
```
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Foo": "Bar",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.79.1"
  },
  "origin": "172.28.0.1, 99.242.70.243",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

We've sent an API request to the Gateway. We can see that the sample custom plugin has injected an HTTP header with a value of *Foo:Bar*. This header was echoed back in the Response Body via the mock Httpbin server.

The `./tyk/scripts/bootstrap-oss.sh` script creates an API definition that includes the custom plugin.


## 3. View the analytics

We can see that Tyk Pump is running in the background. Let's check the logs after sending the API request:

```
docker logs custom-go-plugin_tyk-pump_1 
```

Output:
```
time="Feb 23 16:29:27" level=info msg="Purged 1 records..." prefix=stdout-pump
{"level":"info","msg":"","time":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","tyk-analytics-record":{"method":"GET","host":"httpbin.org","path":"/get","raw_path":"/get","content_length":0,"user_agent":"curl/7.79.1","day":23,"month":2,"year":2023,"hour":16,"response_code":200,"api_key":"00000000","timestamp":"2023-02-23T16:29:27.53328605Z","api_version":"Non Versioned","api_name":"httpbin","api_id":"845b8ed1ae964ea5a6eccab6abf3f3de","org_id":"","oauth_id":"","request_time":1128,"raw_request":"...","raw_response":"...","ip_address":"192.168.0.1","geo":{"country":{"iso_code":""},"city":{"geoname_id":0,"names":null},"location":{"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"time_zone":""}},"network":{"open_connections":0,"closed_connections":0,"bytes_in":0,"bytes_out":0},"latency":{"total":1128,"upstream":1111},"tags":["key-00000000","api-845b8ed1ae964ea5a6eccab6abf3f3de"],"alias":"","track_path":false,"expireAt":"2023-03-02T16:29:27.54271855Z","api_schema":""}}
```

As we can see, when we send API requests, the Tyk Pump will scrape them from Redis and then send them to a persistent store as configured in the Tyk Pump env file. 

In this example, we've configured a simple `STDOUT` Pump where the records will be printed to the Standard OUT (docker logs!)

## 4. Next steps

Try updating the code of the plugin and experimenting. Once you've made changes to the example plugin, please run `make build` to compile the plugin and reload the gateway with the changes.

When finished, please run `make down` to bring down the stack.


## Summary

This tutorial has explained how to:
1. Bootstrap the getting started example plugin in Tyk Gateway environment.
2. Test the example plugin.
3. View the analytics.
4. Next steps.
