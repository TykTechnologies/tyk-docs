title: "How To Serve Plugins"
---

If you are using gRPC, [please visit the gRPC section](/plugins/supported-languages/rich-plugins/grpc), as you don't add plugin files to the Tyk Gateway for it to read, it will simply make a connection to your gRPC server.

**For everything else, there are two ways to add custom plugins:**

1.  Publish the plugin on an HTTP Server so the Gateway can download it. [This is called Bundling.](/plugins/how-to-serve-plugins/plugin-bundles)

2.  Mount your custom plugin on the Gateway's file system.  Find examples under your favorite  programming language under [Supported Languages] (/plugins/supported-languages). 

#### Approach #2 Examples
