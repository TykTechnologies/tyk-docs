### Requirements

Tyk uses [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/). The main requirement is the LuaJIT shared library, you may find this as `libluajit-x` in most distros.

For Ubuntu 14.04 you may use:

`$ apt-get install libluajit-5.1-2
$ apt-get install luarocks`

The LuaJIT required modules are as follows:

*   [lua-cjson](https://github.com/mpx/lua-cjson): in case you have `luarocks`, run: `$ luarocks install lua-cjson`

### How to write LuaJIT Plugins

We have a demo plugin hosted in the repo [tyk-plugin-demo-lua](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-plugin-demo-lua). The project implements a simple middleware for header injection, using a Pre hook (see [Tyk custom middleware hooks](/plugins/supported-languages/javascript-middleware/middleware-scripting-guide)) and [mymiddleware.lua](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-plugin-demo-lua/blob/master/mymiddleware.lua).
### Lua Performance
Lua support is currently in beta stage. We are planning performance optimizations for future releases.
### Tyk Lua API Methods
Tyk Lua API methods aren’t currently supported.
