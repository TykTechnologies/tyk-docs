## Introduction

Control Planes are situated in your Organization's home region and provide links to an instance of the [Tyk Dashboard](/tyk-dashboard) and the [Developer Portal](/tyk-developer-portal). The Dashboard is where you perform all your API tasks. The developer portal allows your 3rd party developers access to your APIs. Cloud Data Planes are then connected to your Control Planes.

## Prerequisites

All [user roles](/tyk-cloud/teams-users#assign-user-roles) can edit, deploy, undeploy, restart, redeploy all deployments within a team. Only the Organization Admin and the Team Admin can create or delete deployments.

## Adding a new Control Plane

Watch our video on setting up a Control Plane and a Cloud Data Plane.
