### What is monitored?
Tyk Cloud keeps track of two metrics:    

- **Throughput** - This is the total amount of data that has been transferred(ingress/egress) through a deployment. 
- **Storage** - This is the total amount of data stored as [analytics by Tyk Dashboard](/tyk-dashboard-analytics). An example is *per request* statistics containing information about each request, like path or status.

### How to check metrics
Login to Tyk Cloud and click on *Monitoring* within the *Operations* menu. Enable *Throughput* to display throughput metrics.

You can also optionally filter for metrics by date.

Here you can see the metrics broken down per environment and a list of the top 5 control and cloud data planes.
