## Introduction

Environments are used to group your [Control Plane](/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#control-plane) and [Cloud Data Planes](/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#cloud-data-plane) into logical groups. For example you may want to create environments that reflect different departments of your organization.


<Note>
The number of Environments you can create is determined by your [plan](/tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans)
</Note>


## Prerequisites

3. Give your new Environment a name
