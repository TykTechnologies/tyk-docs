This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to add a payment method to your Tyk Cloud account, ensuring uninterrupted access to your API management services.

## Adding a payment method to your account

**Note:** You must have *Billing Admin* user rights to add a payment method. 

Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are logged in to *Tyk Cloud UI* as a Billing Admin user.
2. Navigate to <a href="https://account.cloud-ara.tyk.io/payment-method" className="external-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACCOUNT & BILLING --> Payment Method</a>. If you lack the necessary user rights, you will be directed to the main [OPERATIONS](https://dashboard.cloud-ara.tyk.io/) screen (the main login page).
3. Enter your card details and click *Save*.
4. You'll see a confirmation that the payment method was successfully added.



    <Note>
    **Note about card payments**

    Currently, *Tyk Cloud* exclusively supports card payments. For alternative payment methods, please [contact us](https://tyk.io/contact/).
    </Note>


## Payment Method Maintenance

As a *Billing Admin* user, you have the ability to edit or delete an existing payment method. Deleting a payment method without adding a new one will result in your plan going into [retirement](/tyk-cloud/account-billing/retirement) at the end of your current billing cycle.
