# Teams View for Tyk AI Studio

The Teams View allows administrators to manage role-based access control by organizing users into teams. Teams define permissions and access levels across the portal, enabling streamlined user management.

---

#### **Table Overview**
The teams are displayed in a tabular format with the following columns:

1. **ID**:
   A unique identifier assigned to each team for easy reference.

2. **Name**:
   The name of the team, describing its role or purpose (e.g., "Solutions Architects," "Customer Support").

3. **Actions**:
   A menu (represented by three dots) allowing administrators to perform additional actions on a team, such as editing its details, managing permissions, or deleting it.

---

#### **Features**
1. **Add Team Button**:
   Located in the top-right corner of the view, this green button allows administrators to create a new team. Clicking the button opens a form to configure the team's name, permissions, and members.

2. **Pagination Dropdown**:
   Found at the bottom-left corner of the table, this dropdown allows administrators to select how many teams are displayed per page (e.g., 10, 20, or more teams).

---

#### **Role-Based Access Control**
Each team represents a set of users with shared permissions. Teams help to:
- Grant or restrict access to specific features or sections of the portal.
- Streamline permission management by assigning roles at the team level instead of individually for each user.
- Enhance security by ensuring users only have access to the resources they need.

---

The Teams View is a critical tool for managing access control efficiently, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions based on their roles within the organization.

### Teams Quick Actions in Tyk AI Studio

3. **Add Tool Catalogue to Team**:

4. **Add User to Team**:
   Opens an interface to add a new user to the selected team. This action facilitates user-role assignment directly from the Teams View.

5. **Edit Team**:
   Redirects to an editing interface where the team's name, description, and permissions can be modified.

6. **Delete Team**:
   Permanently removes the team from the portal. This action may require confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.

#### **Efficiency in Team Management**
These quick actions streamline team management by allowing administrators to update access, assign resources, or modify user roles without navigating away from the Teams View. This improves workflow efficiency, especially in environments with frequent updates or large user bases.
