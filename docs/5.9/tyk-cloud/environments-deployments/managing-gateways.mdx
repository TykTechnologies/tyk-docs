## Introduction

Cloud Data Planes do all the heavy lifting of actually managing your requests: traffic proxying, access control, data transformation, logging and more.

## Prerequisites

All [user roles](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/teams-users#assign-user-roles) can edit, deploy, undeploy, restart, redeploy all deployments within a team. Only the Organization Admin and the Team Admin can create or delete deployments.

## Adding a new Cloud Data Plane

Watch our video on setting up a Control Plane and a Cloud Data Plane.

<Note>
The number of Cloud Data Planes you can add is dependent on your [plan](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/account-billing#select-a-payment-plan)
</Note>


1. From the Deployments screen click **Add Deployment**
2. Enter a name for the new Gateway
3. Select Cloud Data Plane from the Type drop-down list
4. Select the Bundle Channel and Version
5. (Optional) Enter a [custom domain](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/using-custom-domains) if required
6. (Optional) Enable [plugins](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/using-plugins) if required

## Edit Cloud Data Planes

You can edit the following Control Plane settings:
* Change the Gateway name
* Add a [custom domain](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/using-custom-domains)
* Change the Bundle Channel and Bundle Version
* Enable [plugins](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/using-plugins)



    <Note>
    The use of custom domains is dependent on your [plan](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/account-billing#select-a-payment-plan)
    </Note>

### Auto Upgrade

The Auto Upgrade feature is only available for Control Plane deployments. When enabled on a Control Plane, it will automatically upgrade the corresponding data planes related to this control plane. For more information, see the [Tyk Cloud Control Plane Auto Upgrade Documentation](/docs/5.9/tyk-cloud/environments-deployments/managing-control-planes).
