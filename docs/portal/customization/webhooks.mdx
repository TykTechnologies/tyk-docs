In this section, you will learn how to configure webhooks for events that occur within the portal.
Webhooks enable asynchronous integration with the portal by notifying third-party software about an event that has occurred.
This feature facilitates the implementation of complex business logic when the portal is integrated with third-party systems such as CRMs and ITSM systems.
Typical use cases for the webhooks include:
- An asynchronous approval that occurs externally (e.g., in a third-party CRM, ITSM, or another system managing approvals). In this scenario, an access request (such as an API product access request, an organization registration request, or a new developer profile in an inactive state) is created in the portal. The portal then informs the third-party system by calling a registered webhook.
- A follow-up action that needs to occur after a specific event in the portal. For example, after a developer profile is created, the customer must create a billing profile in their internal billing system (or a profile in a third-party billing engine such as Moesif, Lago, or a similar service) to automatically update and add this information into custom attributes.

## Create a Webhook in Developer Portal

The configuration process consists of two steps:
- Configure connectivity to the target endpoint by specify the Target URL, HTTP method, timeout, and request headers.
- Select types of events that should be sent to the target endpoint.

1. **Configure the Target Endpoint**

    Each webhook delivers events to the **Target URL** via the specified **HTTP Method**. Additionally, it's possible to configure timeout header for requests.

    Finally, for each webhook it's possible to define HTTP headers that should be used for requests to the target URL via the **Headers** section.
    To add a new header, click on the **Add Headers** button, specify **Name** and **Value** of the header.

    Note that you can test connectivity to the **Target URL** by clicking on the **Test Connection** button.
    For testing connectivity, the portal sends a HEAD request to the specified target endpoint.
    Please note that the connectivity is tested only with the HEAD method, and the test call does not include any headers defined in the **Headers** section.

    Once the target endpoint is configured, proceed to the next section to select the types of events that should be sent to that endpoint.

2. **Select Event Types for the Webhook**

    To finish configuration, select types of events that should be sent to the **Target URL** and save the changes. Refer the docs below to know more about [supported event types](#supported-portal-events)
    <img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/edp-select-webhook-events-for-channel.png" alt="Select webhook events" />


## Supported Portal Events

The portal fires the following webhook events:
- [UserRegistered](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#new-user-registered) when a new user is registered.
- [UserAccountActivated](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#user-account-activated) when a user is activated.
- [UserAccountDeactivated](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#user-account-deactivated) when a user is deactivated.
- [PasswordReset](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#password-reset) when a user tries to reset a password.
- [ApplicationRegistered](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#new-application-registered) when a new API consumer application is created.
- [CredentialRegistered](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#new-credential-is-created) when a new API credential is created.
- [AccessRequestCreated](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#new-access-request-created) when a new API access request is created.
- [AccessRequestApproved](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#an-access-request-is-approved) when an API access request is approved.
- [AccessRequestRejected](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#an-access-request-is-rejected) when an API access request is rejected.
- [OrganizationRegistered](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#new-organization-registered) when an API consumer organization is created.
- [OrganizationRequestCreated](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#new-organization-registration-request-created) when a new API consumer organization registration request is created.
- [OrganizationRequestApproved](/docs/portal/customization/webhooks#organization-registration-request-is-approved) when an API consumer organization registration request is approved.
