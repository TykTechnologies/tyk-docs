## Portal Customization Overview

The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal uses themes for customizing the live portal. We provide an out of the box theme that is using our own branding, it’s called the `default` theme. You are welcome to use it and modify it for your needs, yet if you want to start with a blank page, you can also create a completely new theme.

This section provides a complete guide to full customization from the developer's point of view.

The Tyk Developer portal supports the workflow of content managers who're responsible for editing and managing page content.
The purpose of highlighting this flow is to give recommendations on how to organize effective workflows between front end engineers and content managers. Where front end engineers are building page templates and content managers are managing the pages and the content.
