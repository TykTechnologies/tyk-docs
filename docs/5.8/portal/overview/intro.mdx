## What is Enterprise Developer Portal?

The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal is the most flexible and straightforward way for API providers to publish, monetize and drive the adoption of APIs. It provides a full-fledged CMS-like system that enables you to serve all stages of API adoption: from customization the look and feel to exposing APIs and enabling third-party developers to register and use your APIs.

The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal enables you to:

* Completely customize look and feel of the portal.
* Combine multiple APIs into API product and supply them with OpenAPI documentation and tutorials.
* Create multiple organizations and teams to segment your developer audience.
* Create multiple API catalogs to tailor visibility of API products and plans to different audiences.
* Integrate with the most popular Identity providers via Dynamic client registration.
* Fully control the flow of the developer sign-up and enrollment.

## Where does it fit?

Tyk Developer Portal enables multiple instances of Tyk Manager, also referred to as a `Provider` because we will soon include other API Managers and Gateways! Each provider provides a list of Policies, APIs and Keys.
In turn, when the API consumer makes a request and it is approved, the Portal issues a provisioning request to the relevant control plane to issue a key.
