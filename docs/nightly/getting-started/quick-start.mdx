This section provides a step-by-step guide to quickly set up Tyk Self-Managed using Docker. 

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system
2. Install the following CLI tools:
    - [Jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (for JSON processing)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning Github repository)
    - [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) (for making API requests)
3. Tyk Self-Managed license key (from your trial email) 
    - If you are having issues with your trial license, please contact info@tyk.io

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-self-managed-trial && cd tyk-self-managed-trial
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file at the root of your installation

   Create a file named `.env` in the **root directory** of your cloned repository and add your license key:

   ```
   DASH_LICENSE=<your-tyk-license-key>
   ```

   You can use the included `.env.example` file as a reference or starting point.

   > **Note:** Files starting with a dot (like `.env`) are hidden by default in Unix-based systems. Use the `ls -a` command to view them in your terminal.

3. Start the Tyk stack:

### Dashboard Tour

The Tyk Dashboard is your central hub for managing APIs, monitoring performance, and configuring security settings.

<img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-dashboard.png" alt="Self Managed Tyk Dashbaord" />

Let's explore the main sections available in the sidebar:

#### Navigating the Tyk Dashboard

Dashboard is organized into a few key categories:
* **API Management**: In API Management, you can access and edit all your APIs, create [data graphs](/docs/nightly/api-management/data-graph), and add webhooks.
* **API Security**: In API Security, you can manage [keys](/docs/nightly/api-management/policies#access-keys), [policies](/docs/nightly/api-management/policies), and [certificates](/docs/nightly/api-management/certificates) to customize your security settings. 
* **User Management**: In [User Management](/docs/nightly/api-management/user-management), you can control permissions and access for users and user groups. You can also create profiles that help you manage third party identity providers for specific Tyk actions like signing into the portal or logging into the dashboard.
* **Monitoring**: In [Monitoring](/docs/nightly/api-management/dashboard-configuration#traffic-analytics), you can view activity reports, logs, and analytics related to your APIs.
* **System Management**: In [System Management](/docs/nightly/api-management/dashboard-configuration#extend-permissions-using-open-policy-agent-opa), you can affect OPA rules that define fine-grained access control for managing and enforcing permissions on various actions and resources in Tyk’s API management system.
{/* TODO: Remove this when we upgrade this guide to 5.9.0: In 5.9.0 the Classic Portal will be hidden in the Dashboard */}
* **Classic Portal**: In Classic Portal, you can affect permissions and configurations related to your developer portal. The Tyk Developer Portal is a platform that enables you to publish, manage, and promote your APIs to external developers.


For a comprehensive guide to the Dashboard, refer to the [using Tyk Dashboard](/docs/nightly/getting-started/using-tyk-dashboard#dashboard-organization) guide.

#### Understanding the Pre-loaded APIs

2. Click on either "httpbingo API" or "F1 API"
3. Navigate through the tabs to see the various configuration options
4. Pay special attention to the `Endpoints` tab to see how individual endpoints are configured

### Developer Portal Preview

The [Developer Portal](/docs/nightly/portal/overview/intro) provides a dedicated space for API consumers to discover, learn about, and subscribe to your APIs. It bridges the gap between API providers and consumers.

<img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-portal.png" alt="Developer Portal" />

As an administrator, you can customize the portal's appearance, content, and behavior to match your brand and requirements.

#### Exploring Available API Products and Catalogs

Login into the portal as an Admin user with credentials provided in the [previous section](/docs/nightly/getting-started/quick-start#default-credentials-and-access-points) to explore the resources created in the portal. 

The Developer Portal organizes APIs into a structured hierarchy:

**Products, Plans, and Catalogs:**

- **[Products](/docs/nightly/portal/api-products)**: API offerings that developers can consume. In your trial, there's a pre-configured product for the [httpbingo API](http://localhost:3001/admin/api_products).

- **[Plans](/docs/nightly/portal/api-plans)**: Subscription tiers with different access levels and rate limits. [Your trial includes](http://localhost:3001/admin/plans):
  - **Sandbox Plan**: Limited rate (3 requests per 10 seconds) for testing and development
  - **Production Plan**: Higher capacity (100 requests per 60 seconds) for production use

- **[Catalogs](/docs/nightly/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-catalogues)**: Collections of products and plans that can be made available to different audiences. Your trial has a public catalog containing the httpbingo API product and both plans.

#### Understanding the developer experience

To experience the portal from a developer's perspective:

1. You can access the [live portal](http://localhost:3001/) using the admin account. This is the public-facing interface for API consumers.
2. From here the API consumer can:
   1. Browse the [API catalog](http://localhost:3001/portal/catalogue-products) to see available products
   2. View the [API documentation](http://localhost:3001/portal/catalogue-products/httpbin-api-access-1), which is automatically generated from the API definition
   3. Create [apps](http://localhost:3001/portal/private/dashboard) and then Subscribe to a [plan](http://localhost:3001/portal/catalogue-products/httpbin-api-access-1) to get access credentials
   4. Test the API using the provided examples and your credentials

The Developer Portal streamlines the onboarding process for API consumers, making it easy for them to find, understand, and use your APIs.

## Core API Management Capabilities

In this section, we will explore the core API management capabilities of Tyk Self-Managed using the pre-configured APIs.

We will explore how to your secure APIs, manage API traffic, and monitor your API usage. The following sections will guide you through the key features of Tyk API Management platform.

### API Security in Action

API security is an important aspect of API management. Tyk provides [multiple authentication methods](/docs/nightly/api-management/client-authentication/#what-does-tyk-support) to secure your APIs and control access. In this section, we'll explore the security features available in your trial environment.

#### Exploring Authentication Methods

Tyk supports various authentication methods including [Auth Token](/docs/nightly/api-management/authentication/bearer-token), [JWT](/docs/nightly/basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/json-web-tokens), [OAuth 2.0](/docs/nightly/api-management/authentication/oauth-2), and [more](/docs/nightly/api-management/client-authentication/#what-does-tyk-support). In your trial environment, the httpbingo API is pre-configured with Auth Token authentication.

[Auth Tokens](/docs/nightly/api-management/authentication/bearer-token) are the simplest form of authentication. They're easy to implement and understand, making them perfect for your first exploration of Tyk.

1. **Create an API Key:**
   - In the Dashboard, navigate to the "Keys" section in the left menu
   - Click the "ADD KEY" button

      <img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-add-key.png" alt="Click on Add Key" />

   - Under "Access Rights," select the `HTTPBIN API Access` policy
   - Now under the "Configuration" tab, add an alias `httpbin`
   - Click "Create Key" to generate your API key
   
      <img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-create-key.png" alt="Click on Create Key" />

   - Copy the displayed API `key ID` for testing
      
      > **Note:** This key will be used in the upcoming sections to authenticate requests to the httpbingo API.

2. **Test API Access with Your Key:**
   - Open a terminal or API client like Postman
   - Make a request to the API including your key in the Authorization header:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
     ```
   - You should receive a successful response with details about your request

      ```json
      {
         "args": {},
         "headers": {
            "Accept": [
               "*/*"
            ],
            "Accept-Encoding": [
               "gzip"
            ],
            "Authorization": [
               "eyJvcmciOiI2ODkxYTllMzExZDY2NTAwMDE4M2M5Y2MiLCJpZCI6ImM4MmNiYzRhY2Q4NTQyMGZiZGNiZjViN2U2NjY1MWU3IiwiaCI6Im11cm11cjY0In0="
            ],
            "Host": [
               "httpbin:8080"
            ],
            "User-Agent": [
               "curl/8.7.1"
            ],
            "X-Forwarded-For": [
               "192.168.65.1"
            ]
         },
         "method": "GET",
         "origin": "192.168.65.1",
         "url": "http://httpbin:8080/get"
      }
      ```

3. **Try Without Authentication:**
   - Make the same request without the Authorization header:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: invalid-key" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
     ```
   - You should receive an error, confirming that authentication is working

      ```json
      {
         "error": "Access to this API has been disallowed"
      }
      ```

#### Rate Limiting and Quota Management

[Rate limiting](/docs/nightly/api-management/rate-limit) is a technique that allows you to control the rate at which clients can consume your APIs and is one of the fundamental aspects of managing traffic to your services. It serves as a safeguard against abuse, overloading, and denial-of-service attacks by limiting the rate at which an API can be accessed.

In this section we will implement and test rate limiting in Tyk.

**Testing Rate Limiting:**

1. **Create an API Key:**
   - In the Dashboard, navigate to the "Keys" section in the left menu
   - Click the "ADD KEY" button
   - Under "Access Rights," select the `HTTPBIN API Access` policy
   - Under "Key Global Limits and Quota" set the following:
     - **Requests**: 3 requests
     - **Per (seconds):**: 10 seconds
   - Now under the "Configuration" tab, add an alias `httpbin rate limit`
   - Click "CREATE" to generate your API key
   
      <img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-rate-limit-key.png" alt="Docker Container Status of Tyk Self Managed Trial" />

   - Copy the displayed API `key ID` for testing

2. **Observe Rate Limiting in Action:**
   - Open a terminal and run multiple requests in quick succession:
     ```bash
      for i in {1..5}; do
         curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
         echo -e "\n--- Request $i completed ---\n"
      done
     ```
   - After the third request within 10 seconds, you should see a rate limit exceeded error
       ```json
         {
            "error": "Rate Limit Exceeded"
         }
       ```

3. **Compare with a Higher Limit:**
   - Now update the `httpbin rate limit` key and set a value of `100` in the "requests" section of rate limiting.
   - Run the same test and observe that you can make more requests before hitting limits

4. **Clean Up**
   - After testing, you can delete the `httpbin rate limit` API key from the Dashboard.

      <img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-delete-key.png" alt="Delete API Key" />

By exploring these security features, you'll gain a solid understanding of how Tyk helps protect your APIs while providing the right level of access to authorized consumers.

### Traffic Control & Transformation

Tyk API [Gateway](/docs/nightly/tyk-oss-gateway) can control and transform incoming API traffic. It provides [various mechanisms](/docs/nightly/api-management/traffic-transformation) to modify requests and responses, control traffic flow, and optimize performance. Let's explore these capabilities in your trial environment.

#### Testing Request/Response Transformations

Transformations allow you to modify API requests and responses without changing your backend services. This is useful for adapting legacy APIs, standardizing formats, or enhancing responses.

The httpbingo API in your trial includes a pre-configured transformation on the `/xml` endpoint that converts XML responses to JSON format.

**Testing the XML to JSON Transformation:**

1. **Access the XML Endpoint Directly:**
   - Before testing the transformation, you can access the XML endpoint (httpbin) directly to see the raw XML response:
     ```
     curl http://localhost:8081/xml
     ```
   - You should see an XML response from the backend service

1. **Make a Request to the XML Endpoint:**
   - Using your API key from the [previous section](/docs/nightly/getting-started/quick-start#exploring-authentication-methods), make a request to the XML endpoint (on the Tyk Gateway):
     ```
     curl -s -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/xml | jq
     ```
   - Notice that even though the backend returns XML, you receive a JSON response
   - This transformation happens in the gateway, not in the backend service

2. **Examine the Transformation Configuration:**
   - In the Dashboard, go to the "APIs" section
   - Click on the httpbingo API
   - Navigate to the "Endpoints" tab
   - Find the `/xml` path and click on it
   - You'll see the response transformation that converts XML to JSON

   <img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-xml-endpoint.png" alt="XML endpoint in Tyk OAS API" />

Transformations are a powerful way to adapt APIs to your needs without modifying backend code, making them ideal for modernizing legacy services or standardizing API responses across different systems.

#### Exploring Caching Configurations

Caching improves API performance by storing responses and serving them without hitting your backend services for every request. This reduces latency and backend load.

**Understanding API Caching:**

The httpbingo API includes a caching example on the `/get` endpoint with a 10-second cache lifetime. This means that repeated requests within 10 seconds will receive the same cached response.

**Testing Caching Behavior:**

1. **Make an Initial Request with a Unique Value:**
   - Using your API key, make a request to the endpoint with a unique Unique-Header:
     ```
     curl -s -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" \
          -H "Unique-Header: $(uuidgen)" \
          http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get | jq '.headers["Unique-Header"]'
     ```
   - You'll see the Unique-Header value in the response, for example:
     ```
     [
       "62ACF2DD-9116-4B4B-B80E-5F8538C12957"
     ]
     ```
   - The httpbingo service echoes back the headers it receives, including your unique Unique-Header

2. **Make an Immediate Second Request with a Different Header Value:**
   - Immediately make another request with a new unique header value:
     ```
     curl -s -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" \
          -H "Unique-Header: $(uuidgen)" \
          http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get | jq '.headers["Unique-Header"]'
     ```
   - Notice that the Unique-Header value in the response is identical to the first request
   - This confirms you're receiving a cached response, not a new one from the backend
   - Even though you sent a different header value in your request, you got back the same header value from the first request because the response was cached

3. **Wait and Test Again:**
   - Wait 11 seconds (just past the 10-second cache lifetime)
   - Make another request with a new unique value
     ```
     curl -s -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" \
          -H "Unique-Header: $(uuidgen)" \
          http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get | jq '.headers["Unique-Header"]'
     ```
   - You should see a different Unique-Header value in the response, matching your new request
   - This indicates the cache has expired and you're getting a fresh response from the backend

   {/* Add this note: Could also mention that X-Tyk-Cached-Response header is set when a cached response is returned */}
      > **Note:** You can also check the `X-Tyk-Cached-Response` header in the response to confirm whether the response was served from cache or not.

Caching is particularly valuable for responses that are expensive to generate but don't change frequently. By implementing appropriate caching strategies, you can significantly improve API performance and reduce backend load.

### API Monitoring

Understanding how your APIs are performing is important for optimizing performance, planning capacity, and ensuring security. Tyk provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities to give you visibility into your API traffic.

#### Generating Test Traffic

To explore Tyk's monitoring capabilities, you'll need to generate some API traffic that simulates real-world usage patterns and populates the monitoring dashboard.

**Creating Test Traffic:**

1. **Using Command Line Tools:**
   - You can use simple bash loops to generate multiple requests:
     ```
     for i in {1..20}; do curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get; sleep 0.5; done
     ```
   - This sends 20 requests with a half-second delay between each

2. **Generating Diverse Traffic:**
   - Try accessing different endpoints to create a more realistic traffic pattern:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/headers
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/ip
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/user-agent
     ```
   - Include some errors by attempting to exceed rate limits or access without authentication

      ```bash
      curl -H "Authorization: invalid-key" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/headers
      ```
#### Exploring Real-time Analytics

Once you've generated some traffic, you can explore Tyk's analytics capabilities to gain insights into API usage.

**Accessing Monitoring Dashboard:**

1. **View the Main Dashboard:**
   - In the Tyk Dashboard, go to the [Activity Overview](http://localhost:3000/activity-overview) section under "Monitoring"
   - This provides an overview of API usage, errors, and performance metrics
   - The dashboard updates in near real-time as new requests are processed

   - Explore Key Metrics:
      - **Request Volume**: See how many requests are being processed
      - **Error Rates**: Monitor authentication failures and other errors
      - **Response Times**: Track API performance and identify slow endpoints


2. **View Detailed Logs:**
   - In the [Activity Logs](http://localhost:3000/logs) section, you can view detailed logs of all API requests
   - Filter by API, status code, or time range to focus on specific events
   - This is useful for troubleshooting and understanding user behavior

3. **Multiple Analytics Views:**
   Tyk provides multiple views to analyze API traffic:
   - **[By API](http://localhost:3000/activity-api)**: See metrics for individual APIs
   - **[By Endpoint](http://localhost:3000/endpoint-popularity)**: Analyze performance and usage of specific endpoints
   - **[By Key](http://localhost:3000/activity-key)**: Understand how different API keys are being used
   - **[By Error](http://localhost:3000/error-listing)**: Identify common errors and their causes

**Using Analytics for Decision Making:**

The monitoring dashboard helps you answer important questions about your APIs:

- Which endpoints are most popular?
- Are there performance bottlenecks?
- Are users experiencing errors?
- How is usage changing over time?

These insights can guide your API development priorities, capacity planning, and troubleshooting efforts.

Tyk's monitoring capabilities provide the visibility you need to manage your APIs effectively, ensuring they meet the needs of your users while maintaining performance and security standards.
