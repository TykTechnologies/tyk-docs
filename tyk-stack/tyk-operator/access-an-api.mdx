### Tutorial: Update an API to require a key

You might already have realized that our `httpbin` API is keyless. If you check the APIDefinition's specification, the `use_keyless` field is set to `true`.
Tyk keyless access represents completely open access for your API and causes Tyk to bypass any session-based middleware (middleware that requires access to token-related metadata). Keyless access will enable all requests through.
You can disable keyless access by setting `use_keyless` to false. 

#### Step 1: Update your `httpbin.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  name: httpbin
  use_keyless: false
  protocol: http
  active: true
  proxy:
    target_url: http://httpbin.org
    listen_path: /httpbin
    strip_listen_path: true
```

#### Step 2: Apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f httpbin.yaml
```

Or, if you don’t have the manifest with you, you can run the following command:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
    name: httpbin
spec:
    name: httpbin
    use_keyless: false
    protocol: http
    active: true
    proxy:
        target_url: http://httpbin.org
        listen_path: /httpbin
        strip_listen_path: true
EOF
```

If you have set `use_keyless` to false, the default authentication mode is Authentication token.

Now, to access `httpbin` API, you need to include a key to the header. Otherwise, you will get a `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.


```curl
curl -i localhost:8080/httpbin/get
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json
X-Generator: tyk.io
Date: Thu, 03 Mar 2022 15:47:30 GMT
Content-Length: 46

{
    "error": "Authorization field missing"
}%
```


<Note>
Tyk Operator supported authentication types are listed in the [API Definition features](/product-stack/tyk-operator/reference/api-definition) page.

### Tutorial: Create an API key

You need to generate a key to access the `httpbin` API now. Follow [this guide](https://tyk.io/docs/getting-started/create-api-key/) to see how to create an API key for your installation. If you’re using Tyk Open Source, you will need to obtain the API name and API ID that you grant the key access to first.

You can obtain the API name and API ID of our example `httpbin` API by following command:

```yaml
kubectl describe tykapis httpbin
Name:         httpbin
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
Kind:         ApiDefinition
Metadata:
  ...
Spec:
  ...
  Name: httpbin
  ...
Status:
  api_id:  ZGVmYXVsdC9odHRwYmlu
Events:    <none>
```

You can obtain the API name and API ID from `name` and `status.api_id` field.

In our example, it is as follows:

- {API-NAME}: httpbin
- {API-ID}: ZGVmYXVsdC9odHRwYmlu

When you have successfully created a key, you can use it to access the `httpbin` API.

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {Key ID}" localhost:8080/httpbin/get
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {Key ID}",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.77.0",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-6221de2a-01aa10dd56f6f13f420ba313"
  },
  "origin": "127.0.0.1, 176.42.143.200",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

Since you have provided a valid key along with your request, you do not get a `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.
