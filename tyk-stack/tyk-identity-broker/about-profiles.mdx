## What are the TIB Profiles?

TIB takes as input one or many profiles that are stored in mongo or a file (it depends on the type of installation), a profile is a configuration that outlines of how to match a identity provider with a handler and what action to perform (Example: enable Dashboard SSO using OpenID and Microsoft Azure as IDP). The Dashboard adds a user interface to manage the profiles.

## Anatomy of a Profile
Each profile is outlined by a series of attributes that will describe: action to perform, IDP to connect, URL's to redirect on success and failure, etc.
In order to know and understand each of the attributes, implications as well as configure your own profile please consult the profile structure below:

| ResponseIsJson                     | This parameter helps the identity broker understand how to interpret the response body from the target service. If ResponseIsJson is set to true, the broker will expect the response to be in JSON format and will process it accordingly. This includes parsing JSON data to extract relevant information.

The document contains example URLs of endpoints, information about supported bindings, identifiers and public keys. Once you create your TIB profile you can find the SP metadata file under *{Dashboard HOST}/auth/{TIB Profile Name}/saml/metadata* | Yes |
| CertLocation        | An X.509 certificate and the private key for signing your requests to the IDP. The value for `CertLocation` should be the path to a single file with the cert and key concatenated, e.g. `/etc/ssl/certs/example_cert.pem`.
