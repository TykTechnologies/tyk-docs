## Introduction

Catalogs are a way for you to tailor the audience for API products and Plans. You can, for example create a Partner Catalog, with a specific API product tailored to them and a preferential plan not available in your public portal.

In this section, you will learn about how catalogs work and how to create a new catalog to expose your API products and plans.

## Prerequisites

- Connect to a provider [Tyk Self-Managed](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/with-tyk-self-managed-as-provider)
- Create [policies with enforced access rights](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/create-api-product-and-plan) (API Product in the Portal)
- Create one or more [policies with enforced rate limit and quotas](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/create-api-product-and-plan) (Plan in the Portal)

  - Public: External developers can access the catalog
  - Private: The catalog is only visible to developers that are logged in
  - Custom: Only selected teams can access this catalog

    <Note>
    For this audience to apply, the visibility needs to be set to custom.
