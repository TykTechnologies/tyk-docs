## Approve or Reject Provisioning Request

When an external developer is looking to access a specific API(s) as a part of an API Product, they will request access via the public facing portal.

**Prerequisites**

- A portal admin app login
- Log in to a provisioning request sent by an external API consumer

**Step by step instructions**

1. Log in to the portal admin app
2. Navigate to **Provisioning Requests**
3. Select which request you want to approve
4. Click the **more** symbol and select either **approve** or **reject**

## Configure Auto Approval

You can auto approve provisioning requests. From the **Plans** section of the admin app, edit a plan and select **Auto-approve provisioning request** from the **Plan Settings**. By default this setting is not selected, requiring manual approval of each request. Click **Save Changes** to enable this setting.
