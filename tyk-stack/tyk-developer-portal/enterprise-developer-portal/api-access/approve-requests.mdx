## Introduction

API Access Requests are formal requests from API Consumers to access specific API Products and Plans through the Developer Portal. These requests initiate the workflow for granting, or provisioning, API access to users.

### Understanding the Provisioning Request Workflow

When API Consumers discover APIs in your Catalog that they need access to, they initiate a API Access Request through the Live Portal. This request:

- Identifies the specific API Product and subscriptionPlan they want to access
- Specifies which Developer App should receive the access credentials
- Creates an auditable record of the access request

Depending on your configuration, these requests can be processed [automatically]() or require [manual approval](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/api-access/approve-requests#manual-approval-workflow).

## Requesting Access to an API Product

The Enterprise Developer Portal supports two different access flows for API Products. This is configured from the Admin Portal:

1. Log into the Admin Portal
2. Navigate to Portal Settings → General
3. Locate the "API Product Access Flow" section
4. Choose between:
    - Direct Access Flow (Recommended): Streamlined single-product access without a shopping cart
    - Cart-Based Flow: Traditional multi-product shopping cart experience
5. Click Save Changes

### Access Flow Types

#### Direct Access Flow (Recommended)
Streamlined single-product access without a shopping cart, ideal for enterprise environments with multiple internal teams.

#### Cart-Based Flow
Traditional multi-product shopping cart experience, optimized for monetized API models.

### Direct Access Flow
When the Direct Access Flow is enabled, you can request access to API Products immediately without using a shopping cart.

#### Steps:
1. From the **Catalogues** page, choose the API Product of interest and select More info
2. On the API Product detail page, decide which of the available Plans to subscribe to and select **Access with this Plan**
3. You'll be taken directly to the access request page with your selected product and plan pre-populated
4. **Select or Create a Developer App**:
    - **Create new app**: Generate a new app to store your credentials
    - **Existing app**: Choose from your existing apps (if available and compatible)
5. Configure Credentials:
    - If creating a new app: Provide app details and generate new credentials
    - If using an existing app:
        - **Compatible credentials exist**: Choose an existing credential or generate a new one
        - **No compatible credentials**: Generate new credentials (required when authentication type, plan, or app don't match)
6. Select **Continue** to submit your request

#### Credential Compatibility Rules:
For existing credentials to be compatible, they must:
    - Have the same Plan ID as the selected product
    - Not already include the selected product
    - Have a matching authentication type with the product

### Cart-Based Flow
When the Cart-Based Flow is enabled, you can add multiple API Products to a shopping cart before submitting a single access request.

#### Steps:
1. From the **Catalogues** page, choose the API Product of interest and select **More info**
2. On the API Product detail page, decide which of the available Plans to subscribe to and select **Access with this Plan**
3. The combination of API Product and Plan will be added to their *cart*
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all the API Products you want to access
5. Go to the **Cart** using the icon in the top right of the screen
6. Review the selected API Products and Plan
    - All API Products must use the same Authentication method
    - A single subscription Plan will be selected
7. Select which Developer App to associate with the request
    - If approved, the Access Credentials will be stored in this Developer App
    - You can create a new App within the Cart, or select an existing App
8. Select **Submit request**

### After Submission
Regardless of which flow you use:
-  Your access request will be submitted for approval (if required)
- You can track the status of your request in My Apps
- Once approved, credentials will be available in your selected Developer App

## Manual Approval Workflow

The manual approval workflow provides API Owners with oversight of all API access. When an API Consumer completes an [access request](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/api-access/approve-requests#requesting-access-to-an-api-product), API Owners receive notification of pending request via [email](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/setup-email-notifications) and should then:

1. Navigate to the **API Consumers > Access Requests** page in the Admin Portal
2. Review the request
    - User name
    - Developer App
    - Requested API Products
    - Selected subscription Plan
3. Approve or reject the request from the three dot menu
    - If approved, access is provisioned with credentials issued to the specified Developer App
    - If rejected, access will not be granted
    - API Consumer receives notification of the decision via email


## Automatic Approval Workflow

For trusted users or specific API Products, you can enable automatic approval in the [subscription Plan](/portal/api-plans#auto-approve-provisioning-requests).

To configure automatic approval, the API Owner should:

1. Navigate to the **Plans** page in the Admin Portal
2. Select or create the API Plan that should be automatically approved
3. Set the **Auto approve access request** checkbox
    <img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/auto-approve-requests.png" alt="Auto Approve API provisioning requests" />
4. Select **Save changes**

When an API Consumer requests access using this plan, the request will be approved immediately and access credentials provisioned to the Developer App.


<Note>
Despite automatic approval, a record of the request is maintained in the **API Consumers > Access requests** page in the Admin Portal.
</Note>



## Notification of Decision

The Dev Portal sends notification to the API Consumer when their request is approved or rejected.

If the [email service](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/setup-email-notifications) is configured, then:

- When a request is approved:
    - The system sends an approval notification email to the user
    - The email uses the template "approve" with a configurable subject
    - The notification includes details about the approved access
- When a request is rejected:
    - The system sends a rejection notification email to the user
    - The email uses the template "reject" with a configurable subject
