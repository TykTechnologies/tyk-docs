## Introduction

The Developer portal has two types of menus:
1. The main navigation at the top (in the header)
2. The footer at the bottom.

Both of them are defined as [partials](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/customise-enterprise-portal/full-customisation/file-structure-concepts) in the portal directory in `/themes/default/partials/`.

## Manage existing menus

1. Log into your portal
2. Select **Menus** from the navigation menu
3. Click **Primary** to edit the menu

#### Field descriptions

- **Name**: You can give it any name you like, it does not have any effect in the live portal nor the admin app.
- **Path**: This will be used in the code as a reference in order to render the menu. If you don’t have access to the template files, we recommend that you do not edit this field. Editing the `Path` for the default menus will hide the menu as there will be a mismatch between the Path and the reference in the template.
- **Menu Items**:
  1. **Title**: This will be the text that will be displayed in the live portal.
  2. **Path**: this is where the user will be redirected to.
  3. **Children**: In this section you add another nested menu item. We have added a dummy item (Product 1) to demonstrate

Below is the menu item from its own view, which is available from the **Menu Items** option in the admin app side menu.

Here's the menu as displayed in the app:

We have mentioned above the relationship between a menu’s `Path` and the code reference in the menu template. Let’s see how the main menu template looks like (the file is `/themes/default/partials/` directory and is called `top_nav.tmpl`) for the part that we are interested in:

```go
{{ if GetMenus.Primary }}
  {{ range GetMenus.Primary.Children }}
    <li class="nav-item {{ if .Children }}dropdown{{end}} mr-2">
      <a class="nav-link {{ if .Children }}dropdown-toggle{{end}}" href="{{.Path}}" {{ if .Children }}data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup=”true" aria-expanded="false"{{end}}>{{.Tag}}</a>
      {{ if .Children }}
        <ul class="dropdown-menu submenu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdownMenuLink">
          {{ range .Children }}
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="dropdown-item" href="{{.Path}}">{{.Tag}}</a>
            </li>
          {{ end }}
        </ul>
      {{ end }}
    </li>
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
```
Let's pick each line that is used to render the menu attributes and see how they work:

1. `{{ if GetMenus.Primary }}`: This statement calls the “GetMenus” function and checks if there is a menu called `Primary`. If present, it goes into the next line:
2. `{{ range GetMenus.Primary.Children }}` Each Menu (Primary) has some children (Menu items) so what this code does is loop through all the children and they are rendered as below:

```go
<li class="nav-item {{ if .Children }}dropdown{{end}} mr-2">
<a class="nav-link {{ if .Children }}dropdown-toggle{{end}}" href="{{.Path}}" {{ if .Children }}data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup=”true" aria-expanded="false"{{end}}>{{.Tag}}</a>
```
Where:

- `{{ .Path }}` is the Path we have defined from the UI and
- `{{ .Tag }}` is the Name we have defined from the UI.

So this will render all the menu items (Catalogs - as per screenshot) of the menu (Primary - the name we’ve given to the menu).

3. `{{ if .Children }}`: This line checks if the menu item has any submenus. If it does it loops through those children `{{ range .Children }}` and finally renders them `<a class="dropdown-item" href="{{.Path}}">{{.Tag}}</a>` similarly as the main menu items.
So now the child of **Catalogs** which we named **Product 1** has been rendered.
