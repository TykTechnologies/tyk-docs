When considering upgrading your current configuration to a new Tyk release, we recommend you consider the following:

## Upgrade strategy

Which strategy do you intend to use?

  - If following the [Blue-Green upgrade](/developer-support/upgrading-tyk/preparations/upgrade-strategies#blue-green) strategy, has the green environment been configured and verified as production-ready?
  - If pursuing the [Rolling upgrade](/developer-support/upgrading-tyk/preparations/upgrade-strategies#rolling-upgrade) strategy, do all Tyk components have a second instance?
  - If you'll have downtime, estimate the expected duration of the upgrade process and plan for potential downtime.

## Backups
Have backups been performed?

  - Databases: Have databases been properly backed up?
  - configuration files: Have you safely back up these file (using version control system such as *git*)?
  - Testing: Have you tested the backups to verify they can be successfully restored in a separate environment?
  - Backup guide: Have you checke our [comprehensive guide for backing up Tyk](/frequently-asked-questions/how-to-backup-tyk)?

## Go plugins
Do you use custom go plugins with your APIs?

  - Go plugin must be [recompiled](/developer-support/upgrading-tyk/go-plugins) for the new version.
  - Identify all Go plugins in use with all your API definitions.
  - Allow sufficient time for testing and troubleshooting Go plugins after the upgrade.

## Linux users
Which Linux distributions is currently in use?

    - Was Tyk deployed via a repository or a local package file `.rpm` (used be *CentOS* and *RHEL*) or `.deb` (*Debian*
     and its derivative *Ubuntu*)?
    - Is the targeted version available on [packagecloud.io/tyk](https://packagecloud.io/tyk) or in an intended repository?

## Communication
Communicate with stakeholders and users about the upgrade schedule and expected impact on services.

## Upgrade Checklist:

  - Choose an upgrade strategy or manage downtime
  - Check Linux distribution and Tyk version availability
  - Perform and test backups
  - Identify and plan for custom Go plugin recompilation and testing
  - Communicate with stakeholders
