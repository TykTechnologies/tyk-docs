## 1.23.0 Release Notes

Additionally, we added an **embedded product tour** to enhance the deployment experience, offering a guided walkthrough of Tyk Dashboard’s features, ideal for users familiarizing themselves with the platform during onboarding.

    <AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'"Add Portal Deployment" widget hidden for team members'}>
The "Add Portal Deployment" widget on the Environment page is now hidden for team members, providing a cleaner and more tailored UI experience by limiting portal management options to authorized roles 
      only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'"Delete User" button hidden for org admin on Org+Billing admin profiles'}>
The "Delete User" button for Org Admins has been hidden when viewing Org+Billing Admin profiles on the Teams page. Previously, Org Admins could see this button but would encounter an error message, "operation on this class is not permitted," when attempting deletion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Standardized behavior for "Upgrade" and "Account & Billing" buttons'}>
The behavior for accessing the billing app through the 'Upgrade' and 'Account & Billing' buttons has been standardized. Previously, clicking the 'Upgrade' button opened the billing app in a new tab, while 'Account & Billing' opened it in the same tab. Now, both buttons open the billing app consistently in the same tab.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Direct access to "/password-reset" page now accessible without redirect'}>
Fixed an issue where accessing the /password-reset page directly redirected users to the login page. Now, users can navigate directly to the /password-reset page without being redirected, providing a consistent experience for password-reset requests regardless of how the page is accessed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Billing sidebar display corrected when no subscriptions are present'}>
We have resolved a display issue in the billing sidebar that occurred when no subscriptions were active. Now, the sidebar menu displays correctly regardless of subscription status, providing a consistent and clear UI for all users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Fix for hybrid codes visibility logic to manage node data retention'}>
This update addresses a critical bug in the Hybrid nodes visibility logic, which previously retained all connected node data for the Hybrid Data Planes indefinitely. The fix ensures that we only contains records from the last 7 days. This enhancement improves system performance at all stages within the Tyk Cloud UI for organizations with Hybrid Data Planes, especially those with multiple connected gateways.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Improve stability for paid customers'}>
We have enhanced separation between free-trial and paid deployments to improve resilience and stability.
