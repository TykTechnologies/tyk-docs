<h4 id="Changelog-v1.7.0">Changelog</h4>
##### Added
<ul>
<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Load Proxy Settings from Environment Variables'}>
TIB now respects `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables when making outbound connections. This change ensures compatibility with air-gapped Kubernetes environments where external services can only be accessed via an HTTP proxy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dynamic State Query Support in OAuth2 Flow'}>
The OAuth2 "state" field can now be dynamically set via the URL or form-encoded body. This improvement allows integration with external APIs that require custom state values, ensuring compliance with various regulatory and enterprise authentication requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Improved Multi-Group Permission Mapping for Identity Providers'}>
Previously, TIB assigned a user to the last matched group when multiple groups were mapped, regardless of the identity provider (SAML, LDAP, OAuth, OIDC, etc.). The new functionality introduces support for multi-group mapping, allowing permissions to be merged. This update is backward compatible and ensures that multi-group rights (combined permissions) are only applied if the user does not have a `groupId` assigned via the Dashboard.
