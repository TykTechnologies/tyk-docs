For Tyk On-Premises installations only, the Dashboard Admin API has two endpoints and is used to set up and provision a Tyk Dashboard instance without the command line.

In order to use the Dashboard Admin API, you'll need to get the `admin_secret` value from your Tyk Dashboard configurations.

The secret you set should then be sent along as a header with each Dashboard Admin API Request in order for it to be successful:

```
admin-auth: <your-secret>
```
