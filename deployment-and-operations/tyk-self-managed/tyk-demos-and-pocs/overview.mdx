If you've successfully completed the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start), congratulations! This page is the **next step** in your Tyk journey and designed for users who are ready to play with Tyk, learn more about Tyk's capabilities, services, and integration options.


We have two feature-rich and comprehensive demo repositories which provides an example installation of Tyk.

Each starts quickly by spinning up Tyk along with various deployment settings, architectures and integrations such as *MDCB, Tyk Operator, Keycloak, Jaeger, Prometheus* and more.

Both repositories include *Postman collections*, to facilitate exploration and experiencing Tyk's features and functionality.

Use these projects as your **playground** to test, configure, experiment with new features and try the various Tyk API definitions for your day-to-day development of APIs. We hope you find them valuable. Feel free to reach out with any feedback.

## These are our demo projects:

1. [tyk-demo](/getting-started/quick-start/tyk-demo) -  *Docker* based
2. [tyk-k8s-demo](/getting-started/quick-start/tyk-k8s-demo) - *Kubernetes* based.
