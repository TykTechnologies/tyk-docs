**Future deprecation of Tyk Classic Portal**

This product is no longer actively developed as it
has been superseded by the new [Tyk Developer Portal](/portal/overview).
<br />
Please note that the Tyk Classic Portal now has limited support and maintenance. Please contact us at
[support@tyk.io](<mailto:support@tyk.io?subject=Tyk classic developer portal>)if you have any questions.
</Warning>


Users that are signed up to your portal are called "Developers", these users have access to a Dashboard page which show them their API usage over the past 7 days as well as the policy and quota limits on their relevant keys.

Developers can sign up to multiple APIs using the API catalog.

Developer accounts belong to an organization ID, so accounts cannot be shared across organizations in a Tyk Dashboard setup.
