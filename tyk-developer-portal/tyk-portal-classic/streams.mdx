As of Tyk v5.7.0, you can now publish Tyk Streams APIs to the Tyk Developer Portal.

## How To Set Up

Simply create a [Tyk Streams API](/api-management/event-driven-apis#getting-started), create a [Policy](/api-management/gateway-config-managing-classic#create-a-security-policy-with-the-dashboard) which protects it, and then [publish it to the Developer Portal Catalog](/portal/overview#publish-an-api-product).
