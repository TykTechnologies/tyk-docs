## Availability

| Component | Version | Editions |
| :-------- | :------ | :------- |
| Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal | Available since [v1.7.0](/developer-support/release-notes/portal#1-7-0-release-notes) | Enterprise |

## Prerequisites

1. **License**: [Contact our team](https://tyk.io/contact/) to obtain a license or get a self-managed trial license by completing the registration on our [website](https://tyk.io/self-managed-trial/).
2. **Working Tyk Environment**: You need access to a running Tyk instance. For setup instructions using Docker, please refer to the [Tyk Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/quick-start).
3. **Admin Access**: You need admin permissions to configure audit logging in the Portal.

## What We Will Do

In this guide, we will:
1. Enable audit logs in the Tyk Developer Portal using the file storage option
2. Configure the log file path and format
3. View the audit logs from the log file

<Note>
The Developer Portal uses file-based audit logging. Unlike the Tyk Dashboard, the Portal does not currently support database storage for audit logs or viewing them through the Portal UI.
</Note>

## Instructions

### 1. Configure Audit Logging

To enable audit logging in the Developer Portal, you need to configure the audit log settings.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Environment Variables">

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
PORTAL_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLE=true
PORTAL_AUDIT_LOG_PATH=/var/log/portal
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Configuration File">

Add the following to your Portal configuration file:

```json
{
  "AuditLog": {
    "Enable": true,
    "Path": "/var/log/portal"
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Ensure the directory specified in `PORTAL_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` exists and is writable by the Portal process. If using containers, mount a volume to persist logs.
</Warning>

For more information on configuration options, refer to the [Portal Configuration Reference](/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration#audit-log-settings).

### 2. Restart the Developer Portal

After updating the configuration, restart your Developer Portal for the changes to take effect:

```bash
# For Docker
docker restart tyk-portal

# For Docker Compose
docker compose restart tyk-portal

# For Kubernetes
kubectl rollout restart deployment tyk-portal -n tyk
```

### 3. View Audit Logs

Once audit logging is enabled, admin actions are recorded in the `portal.log` file located in the directory specified by `PORTAL_AUDIT_LOG_PATH`.

#### Access the Log File

```bash
# View the audit log file
cat /var/log/portal/portal.log

# Follow the log file in real-time
tail -f /var/log/portal/portal.log

# Search for specific actions
grep "admin@example.com" /var/log/portal/portal.log
```

#### For Docker Containers

```bash
# Access logs from a running container
docker exec -it tyk-portal cat /var/log/portal/portal.log
```

#### For Kubernetes

```bash
# Access logs from a running pod
kubectl exec -it deployment/tyk-portal -n tyk -- cat /var/log/portal/portal.log
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title='Permission Denied When Accessing Audit Logs'>

1. **Check if audit logging is enabled**: Verify `PORTAL_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLE` is set to `true`
2. **Verify directory exists**: Ensure the directory specified in `PORTAL_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` exists
3. **Check permissions**: Confirm the Portal process has write permissions to the log directory
4. **Check Portal logs**: Review Portal startup logs for any configuration errors

```bash
# Check if the directory exists
ls -la /var/log/portal/

# Check Portal container logs
docker logs tyk-portal 2>&1 | grep -i audit
```
