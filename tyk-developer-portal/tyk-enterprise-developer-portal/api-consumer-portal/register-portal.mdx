## Introduction

There are two ways for registering a new account
1. Self signup via the form.
2. Receive an invitation from the portal admin.

## Self signup

To use the self sign up flow, you’ll need to:
1. Access the Portal and click **REGISTER**.

2. Complete the **Create an Account** form.

3. Click **Register to developer portal**.
4. If the portal allows signup without approval, you'll get a message that allows you to log in straight away.

## Receive invitation from portal admin

If the portal requires an admin to approve a registration request, after submitting the **Create an Account** form, you will get the following message.
