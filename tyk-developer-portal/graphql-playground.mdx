## Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the GraphQL Playground in the Tyk Developer Portal:

### 1. Create a GraphQL API

1. In the **Tyk Dashboard**, create a new **GraphQL API** by

    - Navigating to **APIs > Add New API** 
    - In the next screen, click on **Try example** and select **Star Wars GQL API** from the list.
    - Click **Use Example** to create the API.

{/* TODO: Add Image */}

2. Now, go to the **Schema** tab and copy the schema text. Save it locally as a file with a **`.graphql`** extension.

    > This schema file will be uploaded to the Developer Portal in a later step.

### 2. Add the GraphQL API to a Product Policy

1. Go to **Policies** in the Tyk Dashboard.
2. Create a new **Policy**.
3. In the **Add API Access Rights** section, add your **Star Wars GraphQL API** to the policy
4. In the **Policy Partitioning** section, ensure only `Enforce access rights` is selected.
5. In the **Configurations** tab 
    - Add **Policy Name** (e.g., `Star Wars GraphQL API Access`).
    - Set key expiry to `key never expires`.
6. Save the policy.

### 3. Configure the API Product in the Developer Portal

1. Upload the GraphQL Schema
    1. Open the **Developer Portal**.
    2. Navigate to **API Products**.
    3. Select the Product associated with your GraphQL API. (e.g Star Wars GraphQL API Access)
    4. Go to the **Documentation** tab.
    5. Upload the previously saved **`.graphql`** schema file.

    This attaches the schema so that the Portal can generate and display your API documentation and Playground.

2. Configure the GraphQL Server Schema
    1. In the same **Documentation** tab, locate the **GraphQL Schema** section.
    2. Select the uploaded schema from the dropdown.

    1. In the same Product view, locate the **GraphQL Server** section.
    2. Add your **GraphQL API endpoint URL** (as exposed from the Gateway).
    3. Click **Save**.

    This endpoint will be used by the Playground to execute GraphQL queries from the Portal.

3. Now, publish the API Product by selecting the **Public catalogue** from the dropdown.

### 4. View the Playground

1. Open your **Live Portal**.
2. Go to **Product Catalogues** and locate your GraphQL Product.
3. Click **Docs**.
4. Select the API documentation for your GraphQL API.

You should now see the **embedded GraphQL Playground**, ready for interactive query testing.
