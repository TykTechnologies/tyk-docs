## What is Tyk Open Source

Open source is at the heart of what we do. Anything that is API Gateway-related lives in the Gateway, or is critical for the Gateway to work is open and freely available via our [Github](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk).

The Tyk Gateway is fully open-source.  It's all the same Gateway that's used by you (the community!), by our enterprise products, as well as our SaaS.

Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: sign up for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, get started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.
