### Description

Users receive an "API catalog not found" error message when they visit the Developer Portal.

### Cause

The catalog hasn't been initialised yet.

We have [tutorials](/publish-api) on how to publish to a developer portal using API catalogs. It may also be worth checking that the key generated by the policy hasn't expired.
