## Register a New API User

Developers need to register with the portal to access API Products and manage their applications. This section outlines how developers can register with the portal, access API Products, and reset their passwords if needed.

There are two ways for registering a new account
1. Self signup via the form.
2. Receive an invitation from the portal admin.

Here you’ll learn about how to add and invite a new external user to the developer portal.

**Prerequisites**

- A Tyk portal installation
- Log in to the portal admin app

## Self Registration/Signup

To use the self sign up flow, you’ll need to:
1. Access the Portal and click **REGISTER**.

2. Complete the **Create an Account** form.

3. Click **Register to developer portal**.
4. If the portal allows signup without approval, you'll get a message that allows you to log in straight away.

5. If the portal requires an admin to approve a registration request, after submitting the **Create an Account** form, you will get the following message.

## Invite a New User

1. From the **API Consumers > Users** menu Click **Add new user**.

2. In the **Add user** dialog, enter **First** and **Last** names, and **Email**.
3. Select an organization to which to register your user.
4. You can also set a password for a user by typing it in the **Set password** field. Check the **User must change password at the next login** if you wish your developer to change their password at next login.

    Please note, that you can either send the invite email or set the password yourself, but you cannot use both methods.

5. Click **Save** to add your user.
6. To generate the invite email, click **More Options** in the Overview section and then **Send invite**.

    The user will receive an email with a link to the registration form. This option is only available if you didn't set the password before.
    To customize the invite email, please refer to the [Email customization section](/docs3/nightly/portal/customization/email-notifications) for guidance.
