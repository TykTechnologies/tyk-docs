## Introduction

From v2.9.3 Redis Sentinel is supported.

Similar to Redis Cluster, our Gateway, Dashboard and Pump all support integration with Redis Sentinel.

To configure Tyk to work with Redis Sentinel, list your servers under `addrs` and set the master name in your Gateway, Dashboard, Pump and MDCB config. Unlike Redis Cluster, `enable_cluster` should **not** be set.  Indicative config snippets as follows:

<RedisVersions />

## Gateway

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

## Dashboard

```json
"redis_addrs": [
  "server1:26379",
  "server2:26379",
  "server3:26379"
],
"redis_master_name": "mymaster"
```

## Pump

```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```


<Warning>
When using Bitnami charts to install Redis Sentinel in k8s, a Redis service is exposed, which means that standard Redis config is required instead of the above setup, i.e. a single server in `addrs` and `master_name` is not required.
</Warning>


## Support for Redis Sentinel AUTH

To support the use of Redis Sentinel AUTH (introduced in Redis 5.0.1) we have added the following global config settings in Tyk v3.0.2:

* In the Tyk Gateway config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Dashboard config file - `redis_sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Pump config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Identity Broker config file - `SentinelPassword`
* In the Tyk Synk config file - `sentinel_password`

These settings allow you to support Sentinel password-only authentication in Redis version 5.0.1 and above.

See the Redis and Sentinel authentication section of the [Redis Sentinel docs](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) for more details.

## Redis Encryption
Redis supports [SSL/TLS encryption](https://redis.io/topics/encryption) from version 6 as an optional feature, enhancing the security of data in transit. To configure TLS or mTLS connections between an application and Redis, consider the following settings in Tyk's configuration files:

- `storage.use_ssl`: Set this to true to enable TLS encryption for the connection.

- `storage.ssl_secure_skip_verify`: A flag that, when set to true, instructs the application not to verify the Redis server's TLS certificate. This is not recommended for production due to the risk of `man-in-the-middle` attacks.

From **Tyk 5.3**, additional options are available for more granular control:

- `storage.ca_file`: Path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file for verifying the Redis server's certificate.

- `storage.cert_file` and `storage.key_file`: Paths to your application's certificate and private key files, necessary for mTLS where both parties verify each other's identity.

- `storage.max_version` and `storage.min_version`: Define the acceptable range of TLS versions, enhancing security by restricting connections to secure TLS protocols (1.2 or 1.3).

### Setting up an Insecure TLS Connection
- **Enable TLS**: By setting `"use_ssl": true`, you encrypt the connection.
- **Skip Certificate Verification**: Setting `"ssl_secure_skip_verify": true` bypasses the server's certificate verification, suitable only for non-production environments.

### Setting up a Secure TLS Connection
- Ensure `use_ssl` is set to `true`.
- Set `ssl_secure_skip_verify` to `false` to enforce certificate verification against the CA specified in `ca_file`.
- Specify the path to the CA file in `ca_file` for server certificate verification.
- Adjust `min_version` and `max_version` to secure TLS versions, ideally 1.2 and 1.3.

### Setting up a Mutual TLS (mTLS) Connection
- Follow the steps for a secure TLS connection.
- Provide paths for `cert_file` and `key_file` for your application's TLS certificate and private key, enabling Redis server to verify your application's identity.

### Example Gateway Configuration
```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "use_ssl": true,
  "ssl_secure_skip_verify": false,
  "ca_file": "/path/to/ca.crt",
  "cert_file": "/path/to/client.crt",
  "key_file": "/path/to/client.key",
  "max_version": "1.3",
  "min_version": "1.2",
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000
}
```
