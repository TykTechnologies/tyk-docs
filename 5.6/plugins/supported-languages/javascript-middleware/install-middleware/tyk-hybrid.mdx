In some cases middleware references can't be directly embedded in API Definitions (for example, when using the dashboard in a Hybrid install). However, there is an easy way to distribute and enable custom middleware for an API on a Tyk node.

A second method of loading API Definitions in Tyk nodes is to add them as a directory structure in the Tyk node. Tyk will load the middleware plugins dynamically on host-reload without needing a direct reference to them in the API Definition.

The directory structure looks as follows:

```text
middleware
  / {API Id}
    / pre
    / {middlewareObject1Name}.js
    /  {middlewareObject2Name}.js
    / post
      / {middlewareObject1Name}_with_session.js
      / {middlewareObject2Name}.js
```

Tyk will check for a folder that matches the `{API Id}` being loaded, and then load the `pre` and `post` middleware from the respective folders.


<Note>
The filename MUST match the object to be loaded exactly.
</Note>


If your middleware requires session injection, then append `_with_session` to the filename.

### Enable the JSVM

Before you can use Javascript Middleware you will need to enable the JSVM

You can do this by setting `enable_jsvm` to `true` in your `tyk.conf` file.
