<Note>
This API helps you to add and delete (CRUD) a list of additional (custom) permissions for your Dashboard users.
Once created, a custom permission will be added to standard list of user permissions.
<br/>
Only Admin Dashboard users will be authorized to use this API.
</Note>



### List Additional Permissions
This API returns by default the initial set of additional permissions defined in your Tyk Dashboard configuration, under [security.additional_permissions](/5.6/tyk-dashboard/configuration#securityadditional_permissions).

Once you update the permissions via the API, they will be stored at organization level.

| **Property** | **Description**          |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Resource URL | `/api/org/permission`    |
| Method       | PUT                      |
| Type         | None                     |

| Param        | None                     |

#### Sample Request

Let's imagine we have already defined two additional permissions: `api_developer` and `api_manager`. In order to add a new permission to this list, just send 
an updated list of permissions by appending the values you want. In this example we will add a `custom_permission` permission.

```{.copyWrapper}
PUT /api/org/permissions HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
authorization:7a7b140f-2480-4d5a-4e78-24049e3ba7f8

{
  "additional_permissions": {
    "api_developer": "API Developer",
    "api_manager": "API Manager",
    "custom_permission": "Custom Permission"
  }
}
```

#### Sample Response

```
{
  "Status": "OK",
  "Message": "Additional Permissions updated in org level",
  "Meta": null
}
```
