Tyk Gateway responses include HTTP status codes that follow the [HTTP status code standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110). They have three digits that describe the result of the request and the semantics of the response. 
The first digit defines the class of response as shown in the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) below:
- 1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
- 2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
- 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
- 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
- 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

## Tyk Gateway error status code

Here we provide a list of all the error status codes (4xx and 5xx) that may be returned by the Tyk Gateway along with their corresponding messages and some guidance on the likely cause of the error. 
Tyk supports [error templating](/5.6/advanced-configuration/error-templates), allowing you to configure the Gateway to return customised messages for certain HTTP error codes.

We also support limited customisation of the error codes and messages returned by custom authentication middleware through the use of [override messages](/5.6/tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#override_messages).
