## 2.1.1
Release date: 2023-03-29

### Fixed
- Updated API Definition to support 5.0.0 Gateways. 
- Fixed one critical CVE issue with go.uuid package.


## 2.1.0
Release date: 2023-02-20

### Added
- Added a new configuration option [enable_ownership](/5.6/tyk-multi-data-centre/mdcb-configuration-options#enable_ownership) that allows MDCB filter APIs by API Ownership. 
- MDCB works without group id. This means that when an Edge Gateway doesn’t have a group, it will defaults to the `ungrouped` group. This has some fallbacks, as we can’t use the synchroniser for the ungrouped gateways.


### Fixed
- Updated API Definition to support 4.3.3 Gateways.
