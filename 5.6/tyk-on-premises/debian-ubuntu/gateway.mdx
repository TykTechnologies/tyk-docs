**Requirements**

[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) is required to run the following commands. Instructions on how install Tyk Gateway with shell is in the <b>Shell</b> tab.
</Note>


## Getting Started
1. clone the [tyk-ansible](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible) repositry

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible
```

2. `cd` into the directory
```.bash
$ cd tyk-ansible
```

3. Run initialisation script to initialise environment

```bash
$ sh scripts/init.sh
```

4. Modify `hosts.yml` file to update ssh variables to your server(s). You can learn more about the hosts file [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

5. Run ansible-playbook to install `tyk-gateway`

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -t `tyk-gateway-pro` or `tyk-gateway-hybrid`
```

## Variables
- `vars/tyk.yaml`

| Variable | Default | Comments |
| --------- | :---------: | --------- |
| secrets.APISecret | `352d20ee67be67f6340b4c0605b044b7` | API secret |
| secrets.AdminSecret | `12345` | Admin secret |
| gateway.service.host | | Gateway server host if different than the hosts url |
| gateway.service.port | `8080` | Gateway server listening port |
| gateway.service.proto | `http` | Gateway server protocol |
| gateway.service.tls | `false` | Set to `true` to enable SSL connections |
| gateway.sharding.enabled | `false` | Set to `true` to enable filtering (sharding) of APIs |
| gateway.sharding.tags | | The tags to use when filtering (sharding) Tyk Gateway nodes. Tags are processed as OR operations. If you include a non-filter tag (e.g. an identifier such as `node-id-1`, this will become available to your Dashboard analytics) |
| gateway.rpc.connString | | Use this setting to add the URL for your MDCB or load balancer host |
| gateway.rpc.useSSL | `true` | Set this option to `true` to use an SSL RPC connection|
| gateway.rpc.sslInsecureSkipVerify | `true` | Set this option to `true` to allow the certificate validation (certificate chain and hostname) to be skipped. This can be useful if you use a self-signed certificate |
| gateway.rpc.rpcKey | | Your organization ID to connect to the MDCB installation |
| gateway.rpc.apiKey | | This the API key of a user used to authenticate and authorize the Gateway’s access through MDCB. The user should be a standard Dashboard user with minimal privileges so as to reduce any risk if the user is compromised. The suggested security settings are read for Real-time notifications and the remaining options set to deny |
| gateway.rpc.groupId | | This is the `zone` that this instance inhabits, e.g. the cluster/data-center the Gateway lives in. The group ID must be the same across all the Gateways of a data-center/cluster which are also sharing the same Redis instance. This ID should also be unique per cluster (otherwise another Gateway cluster can pick up your keyspace events and your cluster will get zero updates). |

## <a name="install-tyk-ubuntu-gateway"></a>Install Tyk Gateway on Ubuntu

Tyk has it's own APT repositories hosted by the kind folks at [packagecloud.io][1], which makes it easy, safe and secure to install a trusted distribution of the Tyk Gateway stack.

This tutorial has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 & 18.04 with few if any modifications.

Please note however, that should you wish to write your own plugins in Python, we currently have a Python version dependency of 3.4. Python-3.4 ships with Ubuntu 14.04, however you may need to explicitly install it on newer Ubuntu Operating System releases.

### Prerequisites

*   Ensure port `8080` is available. This is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (API traffic to be proxied).
*   You have MongoDB and Redis installed.
*   You have installed firstly the Tyk Dashboard, then the Tyk Pump.

### Step 1: Set up our APT Repositories

First, add our GPG key which signs our binaries:

```bash
curl -L https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
```

Run update:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Since our repositories are installed via HTTPS, you will need to make sure APT supports this:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https 
```

Create a file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/tyk_tyk-gateway.list` with the following contents:
```bash
deb https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/ubuntu/ bionic main
deb-src https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/ubuntu/ bionic main
```

<Note>
`bionic` is the code name for Ubuntu 18.04. Please substitute it with your particular [ubuntu release](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases), e.g. `focal`.
</Note>


Now you can refresh the list of packages with:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

**What we've done here is:**

*   Added the Tyk Gateway repository
*   Updated our package list

### Step 2: Install the Tyk Gateway

We're now ready to install the Tyk Gateway. To install it, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y tyk-gateway
```
What we've done here is instructed apt-get to install the Tyk Gateway without prompting, wait for the downloads to complete.

When Tyk has finished installing, it will have installed some init scripts, but will not be running yet. The next step will be to set up the Gateway - thankfully this can be done with three very simple commands, however it does depend on whether you are configuring Tyk Gateway for use with the Dashboard or without (the Community Edition).

#### Verify the origin key (optional)

Debian packages are signed with the repository keys. These keys are verified at the time of fetching the package and is taken care of by the `apt` infrastructure. These keys are controlled by PackageCloud, our repository provider. For an additional guarantee, it is possible to verify that the package was indeed created by Tyk by verifying the `origin` certificate that is attached to the package.

First, you have to fetch Tyk's signing key and import it.

```bash
wget https://keyserver.tyk.io/tyk.io.deb.signing.key
gpg --import tyk.io.deb.signing.key
```

Then, you have to either,
- sign the key with your ultimately trusted key
- trust this key ultimately

The downloaded package will be available in `/var/cache/apt/archives`. Assuming you found the file `tyk-gateway-2.9.4_amd64.deb` there, you can verify the origin signature.

```bash
gpg --verify d.deb
gpg: Signature made Wed 04 Mar 2020 03:05:00 IST
gpg:                using RSA key F3781522A858A2C43D3BC997CA041CD1466FA2F8
gpg: Good signature from "Team Tyk (package signing) <team@tyk.io>" [ultimate]
```

## Configure Tyk Gateway with Dashboard

### Prerequisites

This configuration assumes that you have already installed the Tyk Dashboard, and have decided on the domain names for your Dashboard and your Portal. **They must be different**. For testing purposes, it is easiest to add hosts entries to your (and your servers) `/etc/hosts` file.

### Set up Tyk

You can set up the core settings for Tyk Gateway with a single setup script, however for more involved deployments, you will want to provide your own configuration file.


<Note>
You need to replace `<hostname>` for `--redishost=<hostname>`with your own value to run this script.
</Note>



```bash
sudo /opt/tyk-gateway/install/setup.sh --dashboard=1 --listenport=8080 --redishost=<hostname> --redisport=6379
```

What we've done here is told the setup script that:

*   `--dashboard=1`: We want to use the Dashboard, since Tyk Gateway gets all it's API Definitions from the Dashboard service, as of v2.3 Tyk will auto-detect the location of the dashboard, we only need to specify that we should use this mode.
*   `--listenport=8080`: Tyk should listen on port 8080 for API traffic.
*   `--redishost=<hostname>`: Use Redis on your hostname.
*   `--redisport=6379`: Use the default Redis port.

### Starting Tyk

The Tyk Gateway can be started now that it is configured. Use this command to start the Tyk Gateway:
```bash
sudo service tyk-gateway start
sudo service tyk-gateway enable
```

#### Pro Tip: Domains with Tyk Gateway

Tyk Gateway has full domain support built-in, you can:

*   Set Tyk to listen only on a specific domain for all API traffic.
*   Set an API to listen on a specific domain (e.g. api1.com, api2.com).
*   Split APIs over a domain using a path (e.g. api.com/api1, api.com/api2, moreapis.com/api1, moreapis.com/api2 etc).
*   If you have set a hostname for the Gateway, then all non-domain-bound APIs will be on this hostname + the `listen_path`.
