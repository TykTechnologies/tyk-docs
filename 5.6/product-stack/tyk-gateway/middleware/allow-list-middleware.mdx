The Allow List middleware is a feature designed to restrict access to only specific API endpoints. It rejects requests to endpoints not specifically "allowed", returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. This enhances the security of the API by preventing unauthorized access to endpoints that are not explicitly permitted.

Note that this is not the same as Tyk's [IP allow list](/5.6/tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/api-definition-objects/ip-whitelisting) feature, which is used to restrict access to APIs based upon the IP of the requestor.

## When to use the allow list

#### Restricting access to private endpoints

If you have a service that exposes endpoints or supports methods that you do not want to be available to clients, you should use the allow list to perform strict restriction to a subset of methods and paths. If the allow list is not enabled, requests to endpoints that are not explicitly defined in Tyk will be proxied to the upstream service and may lead to unexpected behavior.

## How the allow list works

Tyk Gateway does not actually maintain a list of allowed endpoints but rather works on the model whereby if the *allow list* middleware is added to an endpoint then this will automatically block all other endpoints.

Tyk Gateway will subsequently return `HTTP 403 Forbidden` to any requested endpoint that doesn't have the *allow list* middleware enabled, even if the endpoint is defined and configured in the API definition.

<Note>
If you enable the allow list feature by adding the middleware to any endpoint, ensure that you also add the middleware to any other endpoint for which you wish to accept requests.

### Case sensitivity

By default the allow list is case-sensitive, so for example if you have defined the endpoint `GET /userID` in your API definition then only calls to `GET /userID` will be allowed: calls to `GET /UserID` or `GET /userid` will be rejected. You can configure the middleware to be case-insensitive at the endpoint level.

You can also set case sensitivity for the entire [gateway](/5.6/tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#ignore_endpoint_case) in the Gateway configuration file `tyk.conf`. If case insensitivity is configured at the gateway level, this will override the endpoint-level setting.

### Endpoint parsing

When using the allow list middleware, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with Tyk's [URL matching](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching) options.

<br />

<Note>
Tyk recommends that you use [exact](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching#exact-match) matching for maximum security, though prefix and wildcard strategies might also apply for your particular deployment or use case.

 ## Allow List middleware summary
  - The Allow List is an optional stage in Tyk's API Request processing chain, sitting between the [TBC]() and [TBC]() middleware.
  - The Allow List can be configured at the per-endpoint level within the API Definition and is supported by the API Designer within the Tyk Dashboard. */}
