## 5.6.0 Release Notes

### Release Date 10 October 2024


<Note>
**Important Update**

**Date:** 12 October 2024  
**Topic:** Gateway panic when reconnecting to MDCB control plane or Tyk Cloud  
**Workaround:** Restart Gateway  
**Affected Product:** Tyk Gateway as an Edge Gateway  
**Affected versions:** v5.6.0, v5.3.6 and v5.0.14  

We have identified an issue affecting Tyk Gateway deployed as a data plane connecting to the Multi-Data Center Bridge (MDCB) control plane or Tyk Cloud. In those Gateway versions a panic may occur when the gateway reconnects to the control plane after it has been restarted.

Our engineering team is actively working on a fix and a patch (versions 5.6.1, 5.3.7 and 5.0.15) will be released soon.

**Recommendations:**

- **For users on versions 5.5.0, 5.3.5 and 5.0.13**  
  We advise you to delay upgrading to the affected versions (5.6.0, 5.3.6 or 5.0.14) until the patch is available.

- **For users who have already upgraded to 5.6.0, 5.3.6 or 5.0.14 and are experiencing a panic**  
  Restarting the gateway process will restore it to a healthy state. If you are operating in a *Kubernetes* environment the Tyk Gateway instance should automatically restart and resolve the issue.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to resolve this. Please stay tuned for the upcoming patch release which will address this issue.
</Note>

This release primarily focuses on bug fixes.
For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog](/5.6/#Changelog-vX.Y.0) below. */}

We are thrilled to announce new updates and improvements in Tyk 5.6.0, bringing more control, flexibility, and
performance. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed
[changelog](/5.6/#Changelog-v5.6.0) below.

#### Per endpoint Rate Limiting for clients

Building on the [per-endpoint upstream rate
limits](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#api-level-rate-limiting) introduced in Tyk 5.5.0 we have
now added [per-endpoint client
rate limits](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting). This new feature allows
for more granular control over client consumption of API resources by associating the rate limit with the access key,
enabling you to manage and optimize API usage more effectively.

#### Gateway logs in JSON format

You can now output Tyk Gateway system logs in JSON format. This allows for easier integration with logging systems and
more structured log data.

#### Go upgrade to 1.22

We’ve upgraded the Tyk Gateway to Golang 1.22, bringing improved performance, better security, and enhanced stability to
the core system.

<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={"Data plane gateways sometimes didn't synchronise policies and APIs on start-up"}>
We have enhanced the initial synchronization of Data Plane gateways with the Control Plane to ensure more reliable
loading of policies and APIs on start-up. A synchronous initialization process has been implemented to avoid sync
failures and reduce the risk of service disruptions caused by failed loads. This update ensures smoother and more
consistent syncing of policies and APIs in distributed deployments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"Quota wasn't respected under extreme load"}>
We have fixed an issue where the quota limit was not being consistently respected during request spikes, especially in
deployments with multiple gateways. The problem occurred when multiple gateways cached the current and remaining quota
counters at the end of quota periods. To address this, a distributed lock mechanism has been implemented, ensuring
coordinated quota resets and preventing discrepancies across gateways.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Rate limits were incorrectly combined when multiple policies were applied to a key'}>
We have fixed an issue where API-level rate limits set in multiple policies were not correctly applied to the same key.
With this update, when multiple policies configure rate limits for a key, the key will now receive the highest rate
limit from the combined policies, ensuring proper enforcement of limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Restored key creation performance to Gateway 4.0.12/4.3.3 levels'}>
We have addressed a performance regression where key creation for policies with a large number of APIs (100+) became
significantly slower in Tyk 4.0.13/5.0.1. The operation, which previously took around 1.5 seconds, has been taking over
20 seconds since versions 4.0.13/5.0.1. This issue has been resolved by optimizing Redis operations during key creation,
restoring the process to the previous duration, even with a large number of APIs in the policy.
