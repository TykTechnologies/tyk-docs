## 5.4.0 Release Notes

### Release Date 2 July 2024

### Breaking Changes
{/* Required. Use the following statement if there are no breaking changes, or explain if there are */}
**Attention: Please read this section carefully**

We have fixed a bug in the way that Tyk calculates the [key-level rate limit](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting) when multiple policies are applied to the same key. This fix alters the logic used to calculate the effective rate limit and so may lead to a different rate limit being applied to keys generated from your existing policies. See the [change log](/5.6/#fixed) for details of the change.

We're thrilled to introduce exciting enhancements in Tyk Gateway 5.4, aimed at improving your experience with Tyk Gateway. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the change log below.

#### Enhanced Rate Limiting Strategies

We've introducing a [Rate Limit Smoothing](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#rate-limit-smoothing) option for the spike arresting Redis Rate Limiter to give the upstream time to scale in response to increased request rates.

#### Fixed MDCB Issue Relating To Replication Of Custom Keys To Dataplanes

Resolved an issue encountered in MDCB environments where changes to custom keys made via the Dashboard were not properly replicated to dataplanes. The issue impacted both key data and associated quotas, in the following versions:

- 5.0.4 to 5.0.12
- 5.1.1 and 5.1.2
- 5.2.0 to 5.2.6
- 5.3.0 to 5.3.2

##### Action Required
Customers should clear their edge Redis instances of any potentially affected keys to maintain data consistency and ensure proper synchronization across their environments. Please refer to the item in the [fixed](/5.6/#fixed) section of the changelog for recommended actions.

#### Fixed Window Rate Limiter

Ideal for persistent connections with load-balanced gateways, the [Fixed Window Rate Limiter](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#fixed-window-rate-limiter) algorithm mechanism ensures fair handling of requests by allowing only a predefined number to pass per rate limit window. It uses a simple shared counter in Redis so requests do not need to be evenly balanced across the gateways.

#### Event handling with Tyk OAS

We’ve added support for you to [register webhooks](/5.6/basic-config-and-security/report-monitor-trigger-events/webhooks) with your Tyk OAS APIs so that you can handle events triggered by the Gateway, including circuit breaker and quota expiry. You can also assign webhooks to be fired when using the new [smoothing rate limiter](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#rate-limit-smoothing) to notify your systems of ongoing traffic spikes.

#### Enhanced Header Handling in GraphQL APIs

Introduced a features object in API definitions for GQL APIs, including the `use_immutable_headers` attribute. This allows advanced header control, enabling users to add new headers, rewrite existing ones, and selectively remove specific headers. Existing APIs will have this attribute set to `false` by default, ensuring no change in behavior. For new APIs, this attribute is true by default, facilitating smoother migration and maintaining backward compatibility.

<ul>
<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Implemented Fixed Window Rate Limiting for load balancers with keep-alives'}>
Introduced a [Fixed Window Rate Limiting](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#fixed-window-rate-limiter) mechanism to handle rate limiting for load balancers with keep-alives. This algorithm allows the defined number of requests to pass for every rate limit window and blocks any excess requests. It uses a simple shared counter in Redis to count requests. It is suitable for situations where traffic towards Gateways is not balanced fairly. To enable this rate limiter, set `enable_fixed_window_rate_limiter` in the gateway config or set the environment variable `TYK_GW_ENABLEFIXEDWINDOWRATELIMITER=true`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Introduced Rate Limit Smoothing for scaling'}>
Implemented [Rate Limit Smoothing](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#rate-limit-smoothing) as an extension to the existing Redis Rate Limiter to gradually adjust the rate based on smoothing configuration. Two new Gateway events have been created  (`RateLimitSmoothingUp` and `RateLimitSmoothingDown`) which will be triggered as smoothing occurs. These can be used to assist with auto-scaling of upstream capacity during traffic spikes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Introduced ‘use_immutable_headers’ for Advanced Header Control in GraphQL APIs'}>
We've added the `use_immutable_headers` option to the GraphQL API configuration, offering advanced header transformation capabilities. When enabled, users can add new headers, rewrite existing ones, and selectively remove specific headers, allowing granular control without altering the original request. Existing APIs will default to `false`, maintaining current behavior until ready for upgrade.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Enhanced manual schema addition for GQL APIs'}>
Introduced an option for users to manually provide GQL schemas when creating APIs in Tyk, eliminating the dependency on upstream introspection. This feature enables the creation and editing of GQL APIs in Tyk even when upstream introspection is unavailable, providing flexibility for schema management as upstream configurations evolve over time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Introduced Tyk v3 GraphQL Engine in Gateway'}>
The new GraphQL engine, version 3-preview, is now available in Tyk Gateway. It can be used for any GQL API by using the following enum in raw API definition: *"version": "3-preview"*. This experimental version offers optimized GQL operation resolution, faster response times, and a more efficient data loader. It is currently not recommended for production use and will be stabilised in future releases, eventually becoming the default for new GQL APIs in Tyk.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Introduced features Object in API Definition for GQL APIs'}>
Enhanced request headers handling in API definitions for GQL APIs by introducing a *features* object. Users can now set the `use_immutable_headers` attribute, which defaults to false for existing APIs, ensuring no change in header behavior. For new APIs, this attribute is `true` by default, facilitating smoother migration and maintaining backwards compatibility.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'New Tyk OAS features'}>
We’ve added some more features to the Tyk OAS API, moving closer to full parity with Tyk Classic. In this release we’ve added controls that allow you: to enable or prevent generation of traffic logs at the API-level and to enable or prevent the availability of session context to middleware. We’ve also added the facility to register webhooks that will be fired in response to Gateway events.

<Accordion title={'Resolved an issue where changes to custom keys were not properly replicated to dataplanes'}>
Resolved a critical issue affecting MDCB environments, where changes to custom keys made via the dashboard were not properly replicated to dataplanes. This affected both the key data and associated quotas. This issue was present in versions:
- 5.0.4 to 5.0.12
- 5.1.1 and 5.1.2
- 5.2.0 to 5.2.6
- 5.3.0 to 5.3.2

**Action Required**

Customers are advised to clear their edge Redis instances of any keys that might have been affected by this bug to ensure data consistency and proper synchronization across their environments. There are several methods available to address this issue:

1. **Specific Key Deletion via API**: To remove individual buggy keys, you can use the following API call:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://tyk-gateway:{tyk-hybrid-port}/tyk/keys/my-custom-key' \ --header 'X-Tyk-Authorization: {dashboard-key}'
```

Replace `{tyk-hybrid-port}`, `my-custom-key` and `{dashboard-key}` with your specific configuration details. This method is safe and recommended for targeted removals without affecting other keys.

2. **Bulk Key Deletion Using Redis CLI**: For environments with numerous affected keys, you might consider using the Redis CLI to remove keys en masse:

```bash
redis-cli --scan --pattern 'apikey-*' | xargs -L 1 redis-cli del
redis-cli --scan --pattern 'quota-*' | xargs -L 1 redis-cli del
```

This method can temporarily impact the performance of the Redis server, so it should be executed during a maintenance window or when the impact on production traffic is minimal.

3. **Complete Redis Database Flush**: If feasible, flushing the entire Redis database offers a clean slate:

```bash
redis-cli FLUSHALL ASYNC
```

**Implications**
Regardless of the chosen method, be aware that quotas will be reset and will need to resynchronize across the system. This may temporarily affect reporting and rate limiting capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Resolved service discovery issue when using Consul'}>
Addressed an issue with service discovery where an IP returned by Consul wasn't parsed correctly on the Gateway side, leading to unexpected errors when proxying requests to the service. Typically, service discovery returns valid domain names, which did not trigger the issue.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Corrected naming for semantic conventions attributes in GQL Spans'}>
Fixed an issue where GQL Open Telemetry semantic conventions attribute names that lacked the 'graphql' prefix, deviating from the community standard. All attributes now have the correct prefix.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Fixed missing GraphQL OTel attributes in spans on request validation failure'}>
Corrected an issue where GraphQL OTel attributes were missing from spans when request validation failed in cases where `detailed_tracing` was set to `false`. Traces now include GraphQL attributes (operation name, type, and document), improving debugging for users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Resolved Gateway panic with Persist GraphQL Middleware'}>
Fixed a gateway panic issue observed by users when using the *Persist GQL* middleware without defined arguments. The gateway will no longer throw panics in these cases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Resolved issue with GraphQL APIs handling OPTIONS requests'}>
Fixed an issue with GraphQL API's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration, which previously caused the API to fail in respecting CORS settings. This resulted in an inability to proxy requests to upstream servers and handle OPTIONS/CORS requests correctly. With this fix, users can now seamlessly make requests, including OPTIONS method requests, without encountering the previously reported error.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Resolved conflict with multiple APIs sharing listen path on different domains'}>
Fixed an issue where the Gateway did not respect API domain settings when there was another API with the same listen path but no domain. This could lead to the custom domain API not functioning correctly, depending on the order in which APIs were loaded. APIs with custom domains are now prioritised before those without custom domains to ensure that the custom domain is not ignored.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Resolved nested field mapping issue in Universal Data Graph'}>
Addressed a problem with nested field mapping in UDG for GraphQL (GQL) operations. Previously, querying a single nested field caused an error, while including another *normal* field from the same level allowed the query to succeed. This issue has been fixed to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the query composition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Fixed an error in the calculation of effective rate limit from multiple policies'}>
Fixed a long-standing bug in the algorithm used to determine the effective rate limit when multiple policies are applied to a key. If more than one policy is applied to a key then Tyk will apply the highest request rate permitted by any of the policies that defines a rate limit.

Rate limits in Tyk are defined using two elements: `rate`, which is the number of requests and `per`, which is the period over which those requests can be sent. So, if `rate` is 90 and `per` is 30 seconds for a key, Tyk will permit a maximum of 90 requests to be made using the key in a 30 second period, giving an effective maximum of 180 requests per minute (or 3 rps).

Previously, Tyk would take the highest `rate` and the highest `per` from the policies applied to a key when determining the effective rate limit. So, if policy A had `rate` set to 90 and `per` set to 30 seconds (3rps) while policy B had `rate` set to 100 and `per` set to 10 seconds (10rps) and both were applied to a key, the rate limit configured in the key would be: `rate = 100` and `per = 30` giving a rate of 3.33rps.

With the fix applied in Tyk 5.4.0, the Gateway will now apply the highest effective rate to the key - so in this example, the key would take the rate limit from policy B: `rate = 100` and `per = 10` (10rps).

Note that this corrected logic is applied when access keys are presented in API requests. If you are applying multiple policies to keys, there may be a change in the effective rate limit when using Tyk 5.4.0 compared with pre-5.4.0 versions.
