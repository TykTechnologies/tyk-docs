#### Added

<ul>

<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Ability to specify static IP for Kubernetes LoadBalancer service'}>
Added an optional `loadBalancerIP` parameter in the chart that allows users to set a static IP for Tyk Gateway and Dashboard services when using the `LoadBalancer` service type. This update provides enhanced control over IP configuration, useful for network stability in environments with multiple load balancers.

Tyk gateway service configuration:
- `tyk-gateway.gateway.service.loadBalancerIP` (default to "")

Tyk Dashboard service configuration:
- `tyk-dashboard.dashboard.service.loadBalancerIP` (default to "")
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Ability to configure Dashboard container port'}>
Enables specifying an alternate port for the container while using standard ports in the service. This option resolves permission issues associated with restricted ports, such as port 443, within containers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'From v1.0 Tyk Operator Requires License Key'}>
Starting from Tyk Operator v1.0, a license key is required to use the Tyk Operator. You can provide it while installing Tyk Stack, Tyk Control Plane, or Tyk OSS helm chart by setting `global.license.operator` field. You can also set license key via a Kubernetes secret using `global.secrets.useSecretName` field. The secret should contain a key called `OperatorLicense`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
