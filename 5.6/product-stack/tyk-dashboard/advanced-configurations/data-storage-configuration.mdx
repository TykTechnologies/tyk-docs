Tyk stores a variety of data in 4 separate data storage layers. You can configure each layer separately to use one of our supported database platforms. Alternatively a single platform can be used for all layers. The 4 data storage layers are as follows:
1. **Main**: Stores configurations of: APIs, Policies, Users and User Groups.
2. **Aggregate Analytics**: Data used to display Dashboard charts and [analytics](/5.6/tyk-dashboard-analytics).
3. **Logs**: When [detailed logging](/5.6/tyk-stack/tyk-pump/useful-debug-modes#what-is-detailed-request-logging) is enabled, request and response data is logged to storage. These logs can previewed in the Dashboard [log browser](/5.6/tyk-stack/tyk-manager/analytics/log-browser).
4. **Uptime**: Uptime test analytics.

Being extensible, Tyk supports storing this data across different databases (MongoDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL etc.). For example, Tyk can be configured to store analytics in PostgreSQL, logs in MongoDB and uptime data in MySQL.

As illustrated below it can be seen that Tyk Pump writes to one or more external data sources via a Redis store. Conversely, Tyk Dashboard reads this data from the external data sources.

The following details are required to manage this configuration:
- Data storage layer type
- Database engine
- Database connection string

The remainder of this document explains how to configure Tyk Dashboard and Tyk Pump to read and write from one or more data storage layers, respectively.

## How To Configure Tyk Dashboard To Read From A Data Storage Layer

Tyk Dashboard has configuration environment variables for each data storage layer in the following format:

```console
TYK_DB_STORAGE_<LAYER>_TYPE
TYK_DB_STORAGE_<LAYER>_CONNECTIONSTRING
```

where *LAYER* can be *ANALYTICS*, *LOGS* or *UPTIME*.

For example, to configure Tyk Dashboard to read logs from a mongo database, the following environment variables are required:

```console
TYK_DB_STORAGE_LOGS_TYPE=mongo
TYK_DB_STORAGE_LOGS_CONNECTIONSTRING=mongodb://db_host_name:27017/tyk_analytics
```

The full set of environment variables are listed below:

```console
TYK_DB_STORAGE_MAIN_TYPE
TYK_DB_STORAGE_MAIN_CONNECTIONSTRING
TYK_DB_STORAGE_LOGS_TYPE
TYK_DB_STORAGE_LOGS_CONNECTIONSTRING
TYK_DB_STORAGE_ANALYTICS_TYPE
TYK_DB_STORAGE_ANALYTICS_CONNECTIONSTRING
TYK_DB_STORAGE_UPTIME_TYPE
TYK_DB_STORAGE_UPTIME_CONNECTIONSTRING
```

It should be noted that Tyk will attempt to use the configuration for the *main* data storage layer when no corresponding configuration is available for logs, uptime or analytics.

Please refer to the [storage configuration](/5.6/tyk-dashboard/configuration#storage) section to explore the parameters for configuring Tyk Dashboard to read from different storage layers.

### How To Configure Tyk Pump To Write Aggregated Analytics Data?

Aggregated analytics corresponds to data that is used for the display of charts and graphs in [dashboard](/5.6/tyk-dashboard-analytics). Tyk Pump can be configured to write aggregated analytics data to SQL based databases or MongoDB.

#### How To Configure Tyk Pump To Write Aggregated Analytics To A SQL Database?


<Note>
SQLite support will be deprecated from Tyk 5.7.0. To avoid disrupution, please transition to PostgreSQL, MongoDB or one of the listed compatible alternatives.
</Note>


Storage of aggregated analytics data has been tested with PostgreSQL and SqlLite databases. The following environment variables can be used to manage this configuration:

- *TYK_PMP_PUMPS_SQLAGGREGATE_TYPE*: Set to *sql_aggregate* to configure Pump to store aggregated analytics data for charts and graphs in dashboard to a SQL based database.

The example below demonstrates how to configure Tyk Pump to write aggregated to a PostgreSQL database:

```console
TYK_PMP_PUMPS_SQLAGGREGATE_TYPE=SQL
TYK_PMP_PUMPS_SQLAGGREGATE_META_TYPE=postgres
TYK_PMP_PUMPS_SQLAGGREGATE_META_CONNECTIONSTRING=user=postgres password=topsecretpassword host=tyk-postgres port=5432 database=tyk_aggregated_analytics
```

#### How To Configure Tyk Pump To Write Aggregated Analytics To A Mongo Database?

Tyk Pump can be configured to write aggregated analytics data to MongoDB. Aggregated analytics are written to a collection named `z_tyk_analyticz_aggregate_{ORG ID}`, where *ORG_ID* corresponds to the ID of your organization assigned by Tyk.

The following environment variables can be used as a minimum to manage this configuration:

- *TYK_PMP_PUMPS_MONGOAGGREGATE_TYPE*: Set to *mongo-pump-aggregate* to configure Pump to store aggregated analytics data in a MongoDB database.
- *TYK_PMP_PUMPS_MONGOAGGREGATE_META_MONGOURL*: Mongo database connection URL.

An example is given below:

```console
- TYK_PMP_PUMPS_MONGOAGGREGATE_TYPE=mongo-pump-aggregate
