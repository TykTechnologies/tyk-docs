#### Release Highlights

##### Tyk v5.3 Compatibility
MDCB 2.5.0 is an update for compatibility for synchronisation with Tyk v5.3 API Definitions.

##### Redis v7.x Compatibility
We have upgraded Redis driver [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) to v9. Subsequently, Tyk 5.3 is compatible with Redis v7.x.

##### MongoDB v7.0.x Compatibility
We have upgraded mongo-go driver to [mongo-go v1.13.1](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases/tag/v1.13.1). It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB. We have also tested that both Tyk 5.0.x+ and Tyk 5.3 are compatible with MongoDB v7.0.x.

##### Security Fixes
We have fixed a security issue affecting MDCB v2.2.0 to v2.4.x, where certain per-API access rights from policies are not properly relayed to edge gateways. We strongly recommend upgrading to MDCB version 2.5.0 to ensure the proper enforcement of per-API access rights across all gateways in your deployment.

Please refer to the [changelog](/5.6/#Changelog-v2.5.0) below.

##### Fixed
<ul>
 <li>
 <AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Fixed relaying per-API access rights to gateways for MongoDB deployments'}>
Fixed a security issue affecting MDCB v2.2.0 to v2.4.x, where certain per-API access rights from policies are not properly relayed to edge gateways. This issue exists only when using MongoDB as storage engine.

It affected GraphQL's field-based permissions, query depth, per query depth limits, and disable introspection settings. Also it affected usage quota of both HTTP and GraphQL APIs. However, "Set per API limits and quotas" and global policy settings (e.g. query depth) are not affected by this issue.

5.0.x, 6.0.x, 7.0.x. If you are using older MongoDB versions e.g. 3.x, please set MongoDB driver to `mgo`.

It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB.
