## Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to customize the visual appearance of API Products and plans with the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal. That includes:
- The display name for API Products and plans.
- The description and logo of API Products that will be displayed on the API Product catalog page.
- Tags for API Products to match them with related blog posts.

## Customize API Products
To customize the visual appearance of API Products:
1. Navigate to the **API Products** menu, select the product that you want to customize (the Payment API in example below). In this menu you can customize the following aspects of API Products:
- **Catalog display name**: This is the name that will be displayed in the external catalog.
- **Featured API Product**: Tick this option for the API Product to appear on the home page under the **Featured products** section.
- **Description**: A short description about what this API Product is. It is displayed in the catalog and on the API Product page.
- **Content**: A long text description that appears on the API Product overview page, the rich text editor enables you to add more information about the API Product e.g. use cases, features, etc.
- **Image**: An API Product logo that is displayed on the catalog and on the API Product pages.
- **Tags**: The tags are used to match the API Product with the related blog posts that have the same tags in common.
 
From that page you can also manage [OAuth2.0 settings](/5.6/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/api-access/dynamic-client-registration.md) and add [Get started guides](/5.6/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started-with-enterprise-portal/manage-get-started-guides-for-api-products) to your API Products, which is covered in the relevant sections.

2. Save changes by clicking on the **Save** button. You should now be able to preview how the API Product will be displayed in the catalog:

Customize plans
1. To customize visual appearance of plans, open the **Plans** menu and select the plan you want to customize. You can customize the following settings:
- **Catalog display name**: The name of the catalog that will be displayed in the API Product page.
- **Scope**: Scope for the [OAuth2.0 settings](/5.6/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/api-access/dynamic-client-registration.md). Please refer to the [OAuth2.0 documentation](/5.6/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/api-access/dynamic-client-registration) for further guidance.
- **Catalogs**: The catalogs in which this plan is available. Catalogs and organization are [covered](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/create-orgs-and-catalogs) later within this getting started guide.
- **Auto-approve settings for access requests**: Determines if access requests for this plan should be approved automatically.
- **Access request frequency**: Defines how often developers can request access to a specific plan. This way the admins can prevent developers from creating too many keys and abusing their automatically approved plans.
