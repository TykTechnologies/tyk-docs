- Added three new configuration options to manage database connections lifecycle: [PORTAL_DATABASE_MAX_OPEN_CONNECTIONS](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration#portal_database_max_open_connections), [PORTAL_DATABASE_MAX_IDLE_CONNECTIONS](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration#portal_database_max_idle_connections), and [PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_MAX_LIFETIME](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration#portal_database_connection_max_lifetime).
