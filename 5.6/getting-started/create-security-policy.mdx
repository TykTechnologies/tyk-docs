A security policy encapsulates several options that can be applied to a key. It acts as a template that can override individual sections of an API key (or identity) in Tyk.

See [What is a Security Policy?](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy) for more details.

## Tutorial: Create a Policy with the Gateway

Adding a policy to the Tyk Gateway is very easy. Polices are loaded into memory on load and so need to be specified in advanced in a file called `policies.json`. To add a policy, simply create or edit the `/policies/policies.json` file and add the policy object to the object array:

```json
{
  "POLICYID": {
    "access_rights": {
      "{API-ID}": {
        "allowed_urls": [],
        "api_id": "{API-ID}",
        "api_name": "{API-NAME}",
        "versions": [
            "Default"
        ]
      }
    },
    "active": true,
    "name": "POLICY NAME",
    "rate": 1000,
    "per": 1,
    "quota_max": 10000,
    "quota_renewal_rate": 3600,
    "tags": ["Startup Users"]
  }
}
```

The above creates a new policy with a policy ID that you can define, with the rate limits, and security profile that grants access to the APIs listed in the `access_rights` section.

- `{API-ID}`: The API ID you wish this policy to grant access to, there can be more than one of these entries.
- `{API-NAME}`: The name of the API that is being granted access to (this is not required, but helps when debugging or auditing).
- `POLICY NAME`: The name of this security policy.

The important elements:

- `access_rights`: A list of objects representing which APIs that you have configured to grant access to.
- `rate` and `per`: The number of requests to allow per period.
- `quota_max`: The maximum number of allowed requests over a quota period.
- `quota_renewal_rate`: how often the quota resets, in seconds. In this case we have set it to renew every hour.
