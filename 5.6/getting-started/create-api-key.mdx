You will see a 200 response with your new key:

```yaml
{
  "api_model": {},
  "key_id": "59bf9159adbab8abcdefghijac9299a1271641b94fbaf9913e0e048c",
  "data": {...}
}
```

The value returned in the `key_id` parameter of the response is the access key you can now use to access the API that was specified in the `access_rights` section of the call.

You will see a response with your new key:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "key": "c2cb92a78f944e9a46de793fe28e847e",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

The value returned in the `key` parameter of the response is the access key you can now use to access the API that was specified in the `access_rights` section of the call.

To create an API Key, you will need the API ID that we wish to grant the key access to, then creating the key is an API call to the endpoint.

**Prerequisite**

- You will need your API secret, this is the `secret` property of the `tyk.conf` file.

Once you have this value, you can use them to access the Gateway API, the below `curl` command will generate a key for one of your APIs, remember to replace `{API-SECRET}`, `{API-ID}` and `{API-NAME}` with the real values as well as the `curl` domain name and port to be the correct values for your environment.

```curl
curl -X POST -H "x-tyk-authorization: {API-SECRET}" \
  -s \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "allowance": 1000,
    "rate": 1000,
    "per": 1,
    "expires": -1,
    "quota_max": -1,
    "org_id": "1",
    "quota_renews": 1449051461,
    "quota_remaining": -1,
    "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
    "access_rights": {
      "{API-ID}": {
        "api_id": "{API-ID}",
        "api_name": "{API-NAME}",
        "versions": ["Default"]
      }
    },
    "meta_data": {}
  }' http://localhost:8080/tyk/keys/create | python -mjson.tool
```

The above creates a new key with the rate limits, and security profile that grants access to the APIs listed in the `access_rights` section.

- `{API-ID}`: The API ID you wish this policy to grant access to, there can be more than one of these entries.
- `{API-NAME}`: The name of the API being granted access to (this is not required, but helps when debugging or auditing).

The important elements:

- `access_rights`: A list of objects representing which APIs you have configured to grant access to.
- `rate` and `per`: The number of allowed requests per period.
- `quota_max`: The maximum number of allowed requests over a quota period.
- `quota_renewal_rate`: how often the quota resets, in seconds. In this case, we have set it to renew every hour.

You will see a response with your new key:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "key": "c2cb92a78f944e9a46de793fe28e847e",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

The value returned in the `key` parameter of the response is the access key you can now use to access the API that was specified in the `access_rights` section of the call.
