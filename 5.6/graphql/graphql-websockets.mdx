Tyk supports GraphQL via WebSockets using the protocols _graphql-transport-ws_ or _graphql-ws_ between client and Tyk Gateway.

Before this feature can be used, WebSockets need to be enabled in the Tyk Gateway configuration. To enable it set [http_server_options.enable_websockets](/5.6/tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#http_server_optionsenable_websockets) to `true` in your `tyk.conf` file.

You can find the full documentation of the _graphql-transport-ws_ protocol itself [here](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/tree/master).

In order to upgrade the HTTP connection for a GraphQL API to WebSockets by using the _graphql-transport-ws_ protocol, the request should contain following headers:

```
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Key: <random key>
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: graphql-transport-ws
```

**Messages**

The connection needs to be initialised before sending Queries, Mutations, or Subscriptions via WebSockets:

```
{ "type": "connection_init" }
```

Always send unique IDs for different Queries, Mutations, or Subscriptions.

For Queries and Mutations, the Tyk Gateway will respond with a `complete` message, including the GraphQL response inside the payload.

```json
{ "id": "1", "type": "complete" }
```

For Subscriptions, the Tyk Gateway will respond with a stream of `next` messages containing the GraphQL response inside the payload until the data stream ends with a `complete` message. It can happen infinitely if desired.


<Note>
Be aware of those behaviors:
  - If no `connection_init` message is sent after 15 seconds after opening, then the connection will be closed.
  - If a duplicated ID is used, the connection will be closed.
  - If an invalid message type is sent, the connection will be closed.
</Note>


### Examples

**Sending queries**

```
{"id":"1","type":"subscribe","payload":{"query":"{ hello }"}}
```

**Sending mutations**

```
{"id":"2","type":"subscribe","payload":{"query":"mutation SavePing { savePing }"}}
```

**Starting and stopping Subscriptions**

```
{"id":"3","type":"subscribe","payload":{"query":"subscription { countdown(from:10) }" }}
```
```
{"id":"3","type":"complete"}
```

### Upstream connections

For setting up upstream connections (between Tyk Gateway and Upstream) please refer to the [GraphQL Subscriptions Key Concept](/5.6/getting-started/key-concepts/graphql-subscriptions).
