You can use an API to import existing keys that were not created in Tyk into Tyk's Gateway.
This doc explains how to do that with the Gateway's APIs directly.

This example uses standard `authorization` header authentication, and assumes that the Gateway is located at `127.0.0.1:8080` and the Tyk secret is `352d20ee67be67f6340b4c0605b044b7` - update these as necessary to match your environment.

To import a key called `mycustomkey`, save the JSON contents as `token.json` (see example below), then run the following Curl command:

The Example `token.json` file

```{.json}
{
  "allowance": 1000,
  "rate": 1000,
  "per": 60,
  "expires": -1,
  "quota_max": -1,
  "quota_renews": 1406121006,
  "quota_remaining": 0,
  "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
  "access_rights": {
    "3": {
      "api_name": "Tyk Test API",
      "api_id": "3"
    }
  },
  "org_id": "53ac07777cbb8c2d53000002",
  "basic_auth_data": {
    "password": "",
    "hash_type": ""
  },
  "hmac_enabled": false,
  "hmac_string": "",
  "is_inactive": false,
  "apply_policy_id": "",
  "apply_policies": [
    "59672779fa4387000129507d",
    "53222349fa4387004324324e",
    "543534s9fa4387004324324d"
    ],
  "monitor": {
    "trigger_limits": []
  }
}
```

The import of the key to Tyk:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/tyk/keys/mycustomkey -H 'x-tyk-authorization: 352d20ee67be67f6340b4c0605b044b7' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d @token.json
```

Test the key after the import:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/quickstart/headers -H 'Authorization: mycustomkey'
```
