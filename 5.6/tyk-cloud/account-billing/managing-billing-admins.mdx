## Introduction

This page explains what a Tyk Cloud billing admin can do as part of your API management process, giving you complete control over your API management.

As a Billing Admin you can perform the following:

* Add, edit and delete [payment methods](/5.6/tyk-cloud/account-billing/add-payment-method)
* Add further users as Billing Admins
* Upgrade or downgrade plans

## Adding a new Billing Admin


<Note>
To be added as a Billing Admin, a user cannot have an existing Tyk Cloud account.
</Note>


### Prerequisites

To add a new Billing Admin team member requires you to have one of the following roles:

* Be an existing Billing Admin
* Be the account creator Organization Admin (this user also has the Billing Admin role assigned to them)

1. Select **Account & Billing** from the Admin menu (if you only have Billing Admin permissions you will automatically be logged into the Account and Billing area).
