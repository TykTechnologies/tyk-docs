## Install with Docker


Tyk has three containers that are available to set up a Docker installation:

* [The Tyk Gateway container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-gateway/)
* [The Tyk Dashboard container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-dashboard/)
* [The Tyk Pump container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-pump-docker-pub/)

All three are required for a full deployment. We recommend that each container is installed on a separate machine for optimum performance.

From v5.5.0 onwards, these images are based on [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless). This means that you will not be able to obtain a shell with `docker run --rm -it tykio/tyk-gateway:v5.5.0 sh`. The image can be inspected with tools like [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

We also have a [Docker Tyk Pro Demo](/deployment-and-operations/tyk-self-managed/tyk-demos-and-pocs/overview#docker-compose-setup), which installs our full Self-Managed solution, which includes our Gateway, Dashboard, and analytics processing pipeline. This demo will run Tyk Self-Managed on your machine.
