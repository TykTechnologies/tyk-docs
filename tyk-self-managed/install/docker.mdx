| Edition   | Deployment Type |
| :------------- | :---------------------- |
| Enterprise | Self-Managed, Hybrid, Cloud |

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Dashboard License](/portal/overview/intro#getting-access)

This guide spins up a full Tyk Self Managed stack; however, if you are interested in learning Tyk Stack, there's an option for [Tyk Demo](/deployment-and-operations/tyk-self-managed/tyk-demos-and-pocs/overview), which is a project that spins up a full Tyk stack that includes pre-populated API definitions of all kinds, with various middleware options, and can also spin up supporting tools such as Prometheus, Keycloak (IDP), etc.

## What's included?

This installation will run Tyk Self-Managed on your machine, which contains 5 containers: Tyk Gateway, Tyk Dashboard, Tyk Pump, Redis and MongoDB.


<Warning>
This installation is NOT intended for production use or performance testing, since it uses docker compose and the configuration files are not specifically tuned for performance testing or high loads. Please visit the [Planning for Production](/planning-for-production) page to learn how to configure settings for optimal performance.
</Warning>


<Note>
- From v5.5.0 onwards, Docker images are based on [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless). This means that you will not be able to obtain a shell with `docker run --rm -it tykio/tyk-gateway:v5.5.0 sh`. The image can be inspected with tools like [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
</Note>

## Instructions

1. **Clone the GitHub repo**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pro-docker-demo
    ```

2. **Edit your hosts file**

    You need to add the following to your hosts file:

    ```bash
    127.0.0.1 www.tyk-portal-test.com
    127.0.0.1 www.tyk-test.com
    ```

3. **Add your developer license**

    From your installation folder:

    Create an `.env` file - `cp .env.example .env.` Then add your license string to `TYK_DB_LICENSEKEY`.

4. **Initialise the Docker containers**

    **With MongoDB**

    Run the following command from your installation folder:

    ```docker
    docker-compose up
    ```

    **With PostgreSQL**

    Run the following command from your installation folder:

    ```docker
    docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.postgres.yml up
    ```

    This will will download and setup the five Docker containers. This may take some time and will run in non-daemonised mode so you can see all the output.

5. **Bootstrap the Tyk installation**

    Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You will be presented with the Bootstrap UI to create your first organization and admin user.
