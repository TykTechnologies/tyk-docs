## Support Lifetime
<!-- Required. replace X.Y with this release and set the correct quarter of the year -->

## X.Y Release Notes <!-- This is for a minor version. Example: 5.6, 5.7 -->
<!-- This section serves as a container for all patch versions within a specific minor version.  
For example, for a minor version `5.6`, it can include notes for `5.6.0`, `5.6.1`, and so on.  

### Guidelines:  
- Even if there is only a minor version upgrade without any patches, you **must** follow this format.  
- If you are adding a patch to an existing minor version, you **do not** need to copy the header for the minor version again. Instead, continue by adding the patch release notes below. -->
