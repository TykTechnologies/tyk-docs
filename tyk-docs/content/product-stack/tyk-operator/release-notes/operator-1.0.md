## 1.0.0 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of **Tyk Operator v1.0**, marking a significant milestone with new features, enhancements, and critical changes. This release introduces support for Tyk OAS APIs, extended capabilities for managing Classic APIs and security policies, and includes **license changes** that you must be aware of before upgrading.

### Release Date 10 Oct 2024

### Release Highlights
<!-- Required. Use similar ToV to previous release notes. For example for a patch release:
This release primarily focuses on bug fixes.
For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-vX.Y.0">}}) below.
-->
##### Support for Tyk OAS API
The Tyk Operator v1.0 release introduces powerful new features designed to enhance how you manage APIs in Kubernetes environments. One of the key highlights is the full support for Tyk OAS APIs, allowing you to define and manage APIs through the new **`TykOasApiDefinition`** custom resource. This integration extends GitOps API Management to Tyk OAS, allowing you to have declarative, versioned, and fully automated control to your APIs in Kubernetes environments.

Key features:

- **Define and Manage Tyk OAS APIs** using the TykOasApiDefinition custom resource.
- **Manage API Definitions in ConfigMaps**: Any changes are automatically tracked and synced to Tyk.
- **Configure Tyk OAS in a Kubernetes-native way**: You can organize APIs by categories or manage multiple API versions easily with the new CRD.
- **Simplify certificate management** by referencing Kubernetes secrets.
- **Use the Tyk Ingress controller** to create Tyk OAS APIs from Ingress specs.

With this release, users benefit from seamless GitOps workflows, ensuring a Kubernetes-native operation workflow. Security is also made simpler with automated certificate synchronization, removing the hassle of manual certificate management.

##### Enhanced Classic API and Security Policy Features
Enhanced support for Tyk Classic APIs continues, with improvements to security policies and new capabilities for setting API and endpoint-specific rate limits, making it easier than ever to customize API usage policies.

This release represents a significant upgrade for both API management and security, offering a more efficient, scalable, and Kubernetes-native way to operate Tyk. Whether you're leveraging Tyk OAS APIs or continuing with Tyk Classic, this version brings the tools and features you need to streamline your workflows and enhance operational efficiency.

### Dependencies {#dependencies-1.1}
#### 3rd Party Dependencies & Tools
<!-- Required. Third-party dependencies encompass tools (GoLang, Helm etc.), databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc.) and external software libraries. This section should be a table that presents the third-party dependencies and tools compatible with the release. Compatible is used in the sense of those versions tested with the releases. Such information assists customers considering upgrading to a specific release.

Additionally, a disclaimer statement was added below the table, for customers to check that the third-party dependency they decide to install remains in support.

An example is given below for illustrative purposes only. Tested Versions and Compatible Versions information will require discussion with relevant squads and QA. -->

| Third Party Dependency                                     | Tested Versions        | Compatible Versions    | Comments |

<details>
<summary>TykOasApiDefinition: new Custom Resource for Tyk OAS</summary>

The `TykOasApiDefinition` custom resource allows you to manage Tyk OAS APIs directly within your Kubernetes environment. You can now categorize APIs, manage multiple versions, and simplify SSL certificate management by referencing Kubernetes secrets. This enhancement offers a Kubernetes-native approach to managing Tyk APIs, streamlining operations and reducing the complexity of versioning and certificate handling across different environments.

<li>
<details>
<summary>Ingress Controller: Support Tyk OAS API as an Ingress Template</summary>

With this release, you can use the TykOasApiDefinition resource as a template for automatically creating Tyk OAS APIs based on Kubernetes Ingress specs. This simplifies the process of generating APIs by leveraging Ingress controller annotations, reducing manual intervention, and automating API creation workflows for better scalability and operational efficiency.

<details>
<summary>SecurityPolicy: Support for Key-Level Per-API Rate Limits and Quota</summary>

This release introduces the ability to configure specific rate limits, quotas, and throttling rules at the API level using the `access_rights_array` in the security policy. Each API now has the flexibility to inherit global limit settings or apply custom limits, making it easier to control API usage on a per-API basis. This provides enhanced granularity in managing traffic, ensuring optimal resource allocation and improved performance under heavy loads.

<details>
<summary>SecurityPolicy: Support for TykOasApiDefinition</summary>

This update extends the security policy to include TykOasApiDefinition resources within the `access_rights_array`, allowing you to manage security policies for both Tyk Classic APIs and Tyk OAS APIs. By specifying the API kind, you can now apply rate limits, quotas, and other access controls to Tyk OAS APIs, streamlining security management in mixed environments.

</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>ApiDefinition: Support for Event Handler</summary>

Tyk Operator now supports event handler integration for ApiDefinition, enabling webhooks to be triggered by specific API events. This allows for real-time, event-driven automation between Tyk and other systems, sending notifications or executing actions as events occur in the API lifecycle. The event_handlers field in the ApiDefinition CRD makes it easy to set up webhook-driven processes for better control and automation across your services.

<li>
<details>
<summary>ApiDefinition: Support timeout Field in Advanced Cache Control</summary>

The advanced cache configuration for ApiDefinition now supports a timeout field, providing greater control over cache behavior. You can define specific cache timeouts for different API paths, allowing for more fine-tuned control over caching strategies. This feature helps optimize API performance, particularly for high-traffic endpoints requiring precise cache management.
```yaml
extended_paths:
  advance_cache_config:
    - path: "/json"    
      method: "GET"
      cache_response_codes: [200, 204]
      timeout: 120
```
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>ApiDefinition: Support new Fields in `VersionDefinition`</summary>

`VersionDefinition` within `ApiDefinition` has been expanded to include additional fields, offering more granular control over API versioning and path management. These new fields allow you to configure version handling more flexibly, enhancing your ability to manage API versions and customize how version data is processed in API paths.
