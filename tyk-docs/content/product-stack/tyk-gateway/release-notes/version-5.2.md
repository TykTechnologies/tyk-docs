### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.2.4}

#### Fixed
<ul>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Output from Tyk OAS request validation schema failure is too verbose</summary>

Fixed an issue where the Validate Request middleware provided too much information when reporting a schema validation failure in a request to a Tyk OAS API.
 </details>
 </li>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Gateway incorrectly applying policy Path-Based Permissions in certain circumstances</summary>

Fixed a bug where the gateway didn't correctly apply Path-Based Permissions from different policies when using the same `sub` claim but different scopes in each policy. Now the session will be correctly configured for the claims provided in the policy used for each API request.
 </details>
 </li>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Plugin compiler not correctly supporting build_id to differentiate between different builds of the same plugin </summary>

Fixed a bug when using the build_id argument with the Tyk Plugin Compiler that prevents users from hot-reloading different versions of the same plugin compiled with different build_ids. The bug was introduced with the plugin module build change implemented in the upgrade to Go version 1.19 in Tyk 5.1.0.
 </details>
 </li>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>URL Rewrite fails to handle escaped character in query parameter</summary>

Fixed a bug that was introduced in the fix applied to the URL Rewrite middleware in Tyk 5.0.5/5.1.2. The previous fix did not correctly handle escaped characters in the query parameters. Now you can safely include escaped characters in your query parameters and Tyk will not modify them in the URL Rewrite middleware.
 </details>
 </li>
 </ul>

- [source code](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/releases/tag/v5.2.3)

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.2.3}

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Python version not always correctly autodetected</summary>

Fixed an issue where Tyk was not autodetecting the installed Python version if it had multiple digits in the minor version (e.g. Python 3.11). The regular expression was updated to correctly identify Python versions 3.x and 3.xx, improving compatibility and functionality.
</details>
</li>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Gateway blocked trying to retrieve keys via MDCB when using JWT auth</summary>

Improved the behaviour when using JWTs and the MDCB (Multi Data Centre Bridge) link is down; the Gateway will no longer be blocked attempting to fetch OAuth client info. We’ve also enhanced the error messages to specify which type of resource (API key, certificate, OAuth client) the data plane Gateway failed to retrieve due to a lost connection with the control plane.
 </details>
 </li>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Custom Authentication Plugin not working correctly with policies</summary>

Fixed an issue where the session object generated when creating a Custom Key in a Go Plugin did not inherit parameters correctly from the Security Policy.
 </details>
 </li>
 <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Attaching a public key to an API definition for mTLS brings down the Gateway</summary>

Fixed an issue where uploading a public key instead of a certificate into the certificate store, and using that key for mTLS, caused all the Gateways that the APIs are published on to cease negotiating TLS. This fix improves the stability of the gateways and the successful negotiation of TLS.
 </details>
 </li>
 </ul>

#### Added

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Implemented a `tyk version` command that provides more details about the Tyk Gateway build</summary>

This prints the release version, git commit, Go version used, architecture and other build details.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added option to fallback to default API version</summary>

Added new option for Tyk to use the default version of an API if the requested version does not exist. This is referred to as falling back to default and is enabled using a [configuration]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#versioning" >}}) flag in the API definition; for Tyk OAS APIs the flag is `fallbackToDefault`, for Tyk Classic APIs it is `fallback_to_default`.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Implemented a backoff limit for GraphQL subscription connection retry</summary>

Added a backoff limit for GraphQL subscription connection retry to prevent excessive error messages when the upstream stops working. The connection retries and linked error messages now occur in progressively longer intervals, improving error handling and user experience.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Community Contributions

Special thanks to the following member of the Tyk community for their contribution to this release:

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Runtime log error incorrectly produced when using Go Plugin Virtual Endpoints</summary>

Fixed a minor issue with Go Plugin virtual endpoints where a runtime log error was produced from a request, even if the response was successful. Thanks to [uddmorningsun](https://github.com/uddmorningsun) for highlighting the [issue](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/issues/4197) and proposing a fix.

- [CVE-2007-6755](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-6755)



#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enforced timeouts were incorrect on a per-request basis</summary>

Fixed an issue where [enforced timeouts]({{< ref "planning-for-production/ensure-high-availability/enforced-timeouts" >}}) values were incorrect on a per-request basis. Since we enforced timeouts only at the transport level and created the transport only once within the value set by [max_conn_time]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#max_conn_time" >}}), the timeout in effect was not deterministic. Timeouts larger than 0 seconds are now enforced for each request.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Incorrect access privileges were granted in security policies</summary>

Fixed an issue when using MongoDB and [Tyk Security Policies]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy" >}}) where Tyk could incorrectly grant access to an API after that API had been deleted from the associated policy. This was due to the policy cleaning operation that is triggered when an API is deleted from a policy in a MongoDB installation. With this fix, the policy cleaning operation will not remove the final (deleted) API from the policy; Tyk recognises that the API record is invalid and denies granting access rights to the key.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Logstash formatter timestamp was not in RFC3339 Nano format</summary>

The [Logstash]({{< ref "log-data#aggregated-logs-with-logstash" >}}) formatter timestamp is now in [RFC3339Nano](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>In high load scenarios the DRL Manager was not protected against concurrent read and write operations</summary>

Fixed a potential race condition where the *DRL Manager* was not properly protected against concurrent read/write operations in some high-load scenarios.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Performance issue encountered when Tyk Gateway retrieves a key via MDCB for a JWT API</summary>

Fixed a performance issue encountered when Tyk Gateway retrieves a key via MDCB for a JWT API. The token is now validated against [JWKS or the public key]({{<ref "basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/json-web-tokens#dynamic-public-key-rotation-using-public-jwks-url" >}}) in the API Definition.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>JWT middleware introduced latency which reduced overall request/response throughput</summary>

Fixed a performance issue where JWT middleware introduced latency which significantly reduced the overall request/response throughput.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>UDG examples were not displayed when Open Policy Agent (OPA) was enabled</summary>

Fixed an issue that prevented *UDG* examples from being displayed in the dashboard when the *Open Policy Agent(OPA)* is enabled.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Sensitive information logged when incorrect signature provided for APIs protected by HMAC authentication</summary>

Fixed an issue where the Tyk Gateway logs would include sensitive information when the incorrect signature is provided in a request to an API protected by HMAC authentication.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Community Contributions

Special thanks to the following members of the Tyk community for their contributions to this release:

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>ULID Normalization implemented</summary>
- Implemented *ULID Normalization*, replacing valid ULID identifiers in the URL with a `{ulid}` placeholder for analytics. This matches the existing UUID normalization. Thanks to [Mohammad Abdolirad](https://github.com/atkrad) for the contribution.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Duplicate error message incorrectly reported when a custom Go plugin returned an error</summary>

Fixed an issue where a duplicate error message was reported when a custom Go plugin returned an error. Thanks to [@PatrickTaibel](https://github.com/PatrickTaibel) for highlighting the issue and suggesting a fix.
</details>

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.2.1}

#### Changed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Log messaging quality enhanced</summary>

Enhance log message quality by eliminating unnecessary messages
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Configurable retry for resource loading introduced</summary>

Fixed a bug that occurs during Gateway reload where the Gateway would continue to load new API definitions even if policies failed to load. This led to a risk that an API could be invoked without the associated policies (for example, describing access control or rate limits) having been loaded. Now Tyk offers a configurable retry for resource loading, ensuring that a specified number of attempts will be made to load resources (APIs and policies). If a resource fails to load, an error will be logged and the Gateway reverts to its last working configuration.

We have introduced two new variables to configure this behaviour:
- `resource_sync.retry_attempts` - defines the number of [retries]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#resource_syncretry_attempts" >}}) that the Gateway should perform during a resource sync (APIs or policies), defaulting to zero which means no retries are attempted
- `resource_sync.interval` - setting the [fixed interval]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#resource_syncinterval" >}}) between retry attempts (in seconds)
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added http.response.body.size and http.request.body.size for OpenTelemetry users</summary>

For OpenTelemetry users, we've included much-needed attributes, `http.response.body.size` and `http.request.body.size`, in both Tyk HTTP spans and upstream HTTP spans. This addition enables users to gain better insight into incoming/outgoing request/response sizes within their traces.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Memory leak was encountered if OpenTelemetry enabled</summary>

Fixed a memory leak issue in Gateway 5.2.0 if [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (abbreviated "OTel") is [enabled](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/open-telemetry-overview/#enabling-opentelemetry-in-two-steps). It was caused by multiple `otelhttp` handlers being created. We have updated the code to use a single instance of `otelhttp` handler in 5.2.1 to improve performance under high traffic load.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Memory leak encountered when enabling the strict routes option</summary>

Fixed a memory leak that occurred when enabling the [strict routes option]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#http_server_optionsenable_strict_routes" >}}) to change the routing to avoid nearest-neighbour requests on overlapping routes (`TYK_GW_HTTPSERVEROPTIONS_ENABLESTRICTROUTES`)
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>High rates of Tyk Gateway reloads were encountered</summary>

Fixed a potential performance issue related to high rates of *Tyk Gateway* reloads (when the Gateway is updated due to a change in APIs and/or policies). The gateway uses a timer that ensures there's at least one second between reloads, however in some scenarios this could lead to poor performance (for example overloading Redis). We have introduced a new [configuration option]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#reload_interval" >}}), `reload_interval` (`TYK_GW_RELOADINTERVAL`), that can be used to adjust the duration between reloads and hence optimise the performance of your Tyk deployment.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Headers for GraphQL headers were not properly forwarded upstream for GQL/UDG subscriptions</summary>

Fixed an issue with GraphQL APIs, where [headers]({{< ref "graphql/gql-headers" >}}) were not properly forwarded upstream for [GQL/UDG subscriptions]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/graphql-subscriptions" >}}).
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Idle upstream connections were incorrectly closed</summary>

Fixed a bug where the Gateway did not correctly close idle upstream connections (sockets) when configured to generate a new connection after a configurable period of time (using the [max_conn_time]({{<ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#max_conn_time" >}}) configuration option). This could lead to the Gateway eventually running out of sockets under heavy load, impacting performance.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Extra chunked transfer encoding was uncessarily added to rawResponse analytics</summary>

Removed the extra chunked transfer encoding that was added unnecessarily to `rawResponse` analytics
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Reponse body transformation not execute when Persist GraphQL middleware used</summary>

Resolved a bug with HTTP GraphQL APIs where, when the [Persist GraphQL middleware]({{< ref "graphql/persisted-queries" >}}) was used in combination with [Response Body Transform]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/response-body" >}}), the response's body transformation was not being executed.
{{< img src="img/bugs/bug-persistent-gql.png" width="400" alt="Bug in persistent gql and response body transform" title="The setup of graphQL middlewares">}}
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Unable to modify a key that provides access to an inactive or draft API</summary>

Fixed a bug where, if you created a key which provided access to an inactive or draft API, you would be unable to subsequently modify that key (via the Tyk Dashboard UI, Tyk Dashboard API or Tyk Gateway API)
</details>
</li>
</ul>


#### Dependencies

## 5.2.0 Release Notes

### Release Date 29 Sep 2023

### Breaking Changes
**Attention**: Please read carefully this section. We have two topics to report:

### Early Access Features:
Please note that the `Tyk OAS APIs` feature, currently marked as *Early Access*, is subject to breaking changes in subsequent releases. Please refer to our [Early Access guide]({{<ref "frequently-asked-questions/using-early-access-features">}}) for specific details. Upgrading to a new version may introduce changes that are not backwards-compatible. Downgrading or reverting an upgrade may not be possible resulting in a broken installation.

Users are strongly advised to follow the recommended upgrade instructions provided by Tyk before applying any updates.

### Deprecations
There are no deprecations in this release.

### Release Highlights

We're thrilled to bring you some exciting enhancements and crucial fixes to improve your experience with Tyk Gateway. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-v5.2.0">}}) below.

#### Added Body Transform Middleware to Tyk OAS API Definition

With this release, we are adding the much requested *Body Transformations* to *Tyk OAS API Definition*. You can now [configure]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#transformbody" >}}) middleware for both [request]({{< ref "transform-traffic/request-body" >}}) and [response]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/response-body" >}}) body transformations and - as a Tyk Dashboard user - you’ll be able to do so from within our simple and elegant API Designer tool.

#### Reference Tyk OAS API Definition From Within Your Custom Go Plugins

Reference the *Tyk OAS API definition* from within your custom *Go Plugins*, bringing them up to standard alongside those you might use with a *Tyk Classic API*.

#### Configure Caching For Each API Endpoint

We’ve added the ability to [configure]({{< ref "/basic-config-and-security/reduce-latency/caching/advanced-cache#advanced-caching-by-endpoint" >}}) per-endpoint timeouts for Tyk’s response cache, giving you increased flexibility to tailor your APIs to your upstream services.

#### Added Header Management in Universal Data Graph

With this release we are adding a concept of [header management]({{< ref "universal-data-graph/concepts/header_management" >}}) in *Universal Data Graph*. With multiple upstream data sources, data graphs need to be sending the right headers upstream, so that our users can effectively track the usage and be able to enforce security rules at each stage. All *Universal Data Graph* headers now have access to *request context* variables like *JWT claims*, *IP address* of the connecting client or *request ID*. This provides extensive configurability of customisable information that can be sent upstream.

#### Added Further Support For GraphQL WebSocket Protocols

Support for [WebSocket]({{< ref "/graphql/graphql-websockets" >}}) protocols between client and the *Gateway* has also been expanded. Instead of only supporting the *graphql-ws protocol*, which is becoming deprecated, we now also support [graphql-transport-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) by setting the *Sec-WebSocket-Protocol* header to *graphql-transport-ws*.

#### Added OpenTelemetry Tracing

In this version, we're introducing the support for *OpenTelemetry Tracing*, the new [open standard](https://opentelemetry.io/) for exposing observability data. This addition gives you improved visibility into how API requests are processed, with no additional license required. It is designed to help you with monitoring and troubleshooting APIs, identify bottlenecks, latency issues and errors in your API calls. For detailed information and guidance, you can check out our [OpenTelemetry Tracing]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/open-telemetry-overview" >}}) resource.

*OpenTelemetry* makes it possible to isolate faults within the request lifetime through inspecting API and Gateway meta-data. Additionally, performance bottlenecks can be identified within the request lifetime. API owners and developers can use this feature to understand how their APIs are being used or processed within the Gateway.

*OpenTelemetry* functionality is also available in [Go Plugins]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/plugins/otel-plugins" >}}). Developers can write code to add the ability to preview *OpenTelemetry* trace attributes, error status codes etc., for their Go Plugins.

We offer support for integrating *OpenTelemetry* traces with supported open source tools such [Jaeger]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/otel_jaeger" >}}), [Dynatrace]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/otel_dynatrace" >}}) or [New Relic]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/otel_new_relic" >}}). This allows API owners and developers to gain troubleshooting and performance insights from error logs, response times etc.
You can also find a direct link to our docs in the official [OpenTelemetry Integration page](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/integrations/)

{{< warning success >}}
**Warning**

*Tyk Gateway 5.2* now includes *OpenTelemetry Tracing*. Over the next year, we'll be deprecating *OpenTracing*. We recommend migrating to *OpenTelemetry* for better trace insights and more comprehensive support. This change will offer you significant advantages in managing your distributed tracing needs.

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.2.0}

#### Added:

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added support for configuring distributed tracing behaviour</summary>

Added support for [configuring]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#opentelemetry" >}}) distributed tracing behaviour of *Tyk Gateway*. This includes enabling tracing, configuring exporter types, setting the URL of the tracing backend to which data is to be sent, customising headers, and specifying enhanced connectivity for *HTTP*, *HTTPS* and *gRPC*. Subsequently, users have precise control over tracing behaviour in *Tyk Gateway*.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added support for configuring OpenTelemetry</summary>

Added support to configure *OpenTelemetry* [sampling types and rates]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#opentelemetrysampling" >}}) in the *Tyk Gateway*. This allows users to manage the need for collected detailed tracing information against performance and resource usage requirements.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added span attributes to simplify identifying Tyk API and request meta-data per request</summary>

Added span attributes to simplify identifying Tyk API and request meta-data per request.

This allows users to use *OpenTelemetry* [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/README.md) to filter and create metrics for increased insight and observability.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Add custom resource attributes to allow process information to be available in traces</summary>

Added custom resource attributes: *service.name*, *service.instance.id*, *service.version*, *tyk.gw.id*, *tyk.gw.dataplane*, *tyk.gw.group.id*, *tyk.gw.tags* to allow process information to be available in traces.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Allow clients to retrieve the trace ID from response headers when OpenTelemetry enabled</summary>

Added a new feature that allows clients to retrieve the trace ID from response headers. This feature is available when *OpenTelemetry* is [enabled]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#opentelemetryenabled" >}}) and simplifies debugging API requests, empowering users to seamlessly correlate and analyse data for a specific trace in any *OpenTelemetry* backend like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Allow detailed tracing to be enabled/disabled at API level</summary>

Added configuration parameter to enable/disable [detail_tracing]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/open-telemetry-overview#step-2-enable-detailed-tracing-at-api-level-optional" >}}) for *Tyk Classic API*.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Add OpenTelemetry support for GraphQL</summary>

Added *OpenTelemetry* support for GraphQL. This is activated by setting [opentelemetry.enabled]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#opentelemetryenabled" >}}) to *true*. This integration enhances observability by enabling GQL traces in any OpenTelemetry backend, like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), granting users comprehensive insights into the execution process, such as request times.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Add support to configure granual control over cache timeout at the endpoint level</summary>

Added a new [timeout option]({{< ref "/basic-config-and-security/reduce-latency/caching/advanced-cache#advanced-caching-by-endpoint" >}}), offering granular control over cache timeout at the endpoint level.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enable request context variables in UDG global or data source headers</summary>

Added support for using [request context variables]({{< ref "context-variables#the-available-context-variables-are" >}}) in *UDG* global or data source headers. This feature enables much more advanced [header management]({{< ref "/universal-data-graph/concepts/header_management" >}}) for UDG and allows users to extract header information from an incoming request and pass it to upstream data sources.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Add support for configuration of global headers for any UDG</summary>

Added support for configuration of [global headers]({{< ref "/universal-data-graph/concepts/header_management" >}}) for any *UDG*. These headers will be forwarded to all data sources by default, enhancing control over data flow.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Add ability for Custom GoPlugin developers using Tyk OAS APIs to access the API Definition</summary>

</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Introspection of GraphQL schemas raised an error when dealing with some custom root types</summary>

Fixed an issue with introspecting GraphQL schemas that previously raised an error when dealing with custom root types other than *Query*, *Mutation* or *Subscription*.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enforced Timeout configuration parameter of an API endpoint was not validated</summary>

Fixed an issue where the [Enforced Timeout]({{< ref "planning-for-production/ensure-high-availability/enforced-timeouts" >}}) configuration parameter of an API endpoint accepted negative values, without displaying validation errors. With this fix, users receive clear feedback and prevent unintended configurations.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>allowedIPs validation failures were causing the loss of other error types reported</summary>

Fixed an issue where *allowedIPs* validation failures replaced the reported errors list, causing the loss of other error types. This fix appends IP validation errors to the list, providing users with a comprehensive overview of encountered errors.
