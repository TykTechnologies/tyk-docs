#### Tyk Streams - asynchronous API management with Tyk

Tyk is now entering the asynchronous API management space with a bang by delivering Tyk Streams to our users!
Many API management solutions fail to fully support event-driven architectures, causing fragmented management, inconsistent security practices, and increased operational complexity. With event-driven architectures on the rise recently, keeping everything under control and enforcing standards at the organizational level has become a challenge.

**Tyk Streams** is an event streaming solution available within the Tyk API Management Platform, which applies proven API management principles to simplify event and streams handling. 
This release brings capabilities to stream data and events using Kafka, Websocket, SSE and HTTP protocols. It also becomes possible to mediate the message format between Avro and JSON on the fly.

- Merge together various sources of events to present to consumers as a unified stream.
- Apply authentication and authorization to streams of messages, just as you do for your RESTful APIs
- Expose async APIs via Tyk Portal, so that they are easily discoverable

All of this possible in self-managed and k8s deployments of Tyk!

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added Stream Analytics Error Handling</summary>

Added to Streams analytics capability to capture and report common error scenarios, including broker connectivity issues and standard HTTP errors, ensuring comprehensive request tracking for Streams-processed requests.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Integrated Streams Validator with Streams API</summary>

Connected the new OAS validator to the /streams endpoint, adding proper error handling and validation responses for invalid stream configurations.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Extended Streams Configuration Validation</summary>

Extended the OAS validator to include Streams configuration validation, enforcing allowlisted components and validating nested broker configurations while implementing schema validation for Streams configurations.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>New Streams Configuration Validator</summary>

Introduced a new validator derived from the existing OAS schema, adapting it for Streams validation with modified requirements for upstreamURL and x-tyk-streaming fields. This validator is now used by both the Dashboard API streams endpoint and streams configuration validator.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added Logging for Streams</summary>

Refined streams logging behavior to match Tyk's logging patterns, reducing unnecessary log output and improving log clarity.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Simplified Streams Configuration Support</summary>

Implemented allowlist-based validation for components in streams configurations, replacing the previous blocklist approach. Supported components now include Kafka, WebSocket, SSE, and HTTP for both inputs and outputs (including broker combinations), along with JSON-Avro bidirectional conversion processors, while other components like scanners, caches, and buffers are blocked by default. This validation is enforced consistently across Gateway, Dashboard API, and UI.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:

- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved HTTP Input Timeout in Tyk Streams</summary>

When using Tyk Streams and sending input via http, the requests sometimes timed out causing a problem for the consumers. The issue has been fixed and now inputs via http for Tyk Streams work as intended.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved backwards compatibility when working with Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

Fixed a backwards compatibility issue with Tyk OAS API schema validation. When downgrading from a Tyk version, schema validation could fail if new fields had been added to the Tyk OAS API definition. This change relaxes the strictness of validation to allow additional properties.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed Policy Merge Issue with Path-Based Permissions</summary>

Resolved a bug where path-based permissions in policies were not preserved when policies were combined, potentially omitting URL values and incorrectly restricting access. The updated behavior ensures that URL access rights from all applicable policies are merged, regardless of policy order, allowing seamless enforcement of combined permissions.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved API Routing Issue with Trailing Slashes and Overlapping Listen Paths</summary>

Fixed a routing issue that caused incorrect API matching when dealing with APIs that lacked a trailing slash, used custom domains, or had similar listen path patterns. Previously, the router prioritized APIs with longer subdomains and shorter listen paths, leading to incorrect matches when listen paths shared prefixes. This fix ensures accurate API matching, even when subdomains and listen paths overlap.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimized Gateway Handling for Large Payloads</summary>

Fixed an issue that caused increased memory consumption when proxying large response payloads. The Gateway now handles large payloads more efficiently in terms of speed and memory usage.
</details>
</li>
</ul>
