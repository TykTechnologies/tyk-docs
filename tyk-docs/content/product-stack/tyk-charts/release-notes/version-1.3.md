#### Breaking Changes
<!-- Required. Use the following statement if there are no breaking changes, or explain if there are -->
For MongoDB users: Tyk Charts 1.3.0 uses `mongo-go` as the default driver to connect to MongoDB. `mongo-go` driver is compatible with MongoDB 4.4.x and above. For MongoDB versions prior to 4.4, please set `global.mongo.driver` to `mgo`. We recommend reading [Choose a MongoDB driver]({{<ref "/planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb#choose-a-mongodb-driver">}}) when you need to change driver setting.

<!-- The following "Changed error log messages" section is Optional!
Instructions: We should mention in the changelog section ALL changes in our application log messages. In case we made such changes, this section should also be added, to make sure the users don't miss this notice among other changelog lines. -->
<!-- #### Changed error log messages
Important for users who monitor Tyk components using the application logs (i.e. Tyk Gateway log, Tyk Dashboard log etc.).
We try to avoid making changes to our log messages, especially at error and critical levels. However, sometimes it's necessary. Please find the list of changes made to the application log in this release: -->

<!-- The following "|Planned Breaking Changes" section is optional!

<!-- 
##### Compatibility Matrix For Tyk Components
Required. Version compatibility with other components in the Tyk stack. This takes the form of a compatibility matrix and is only required for Gateway and Portal.
An illustrative example is shown below.

#### 3rd Party Dependencies & Tools
<!-- Required. Third-party dependencies encompass tools (GoLang, Helm etc.), databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc.) and external software libraries. This section should be a table that presents the third-party dependencies and tools compatible with the release. Compatible is used in the sense of those versions tested with the releases. Such information assists customers considering upgrading to a specific release.

Additionally, a disclaimer statement was added below the table, for customers to check that the third-party dependency they decide to install remains in support.

An example is given below for illustrative purposes only. Tested Versions and Compatible Versions information will require discussion with relevant squads and QA. -->

| Third Party Dependency                                     | Tested Versions        | Compatible Versions    | Comments |

<!-- Required. Use the following statement if there are no deprecations, or explain if there are -->
There are no deprecations in this release.

<!-- Optional section!
