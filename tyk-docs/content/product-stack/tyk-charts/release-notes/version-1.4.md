#### Changelog {#Changelog-v1.4.0}
<!-- Required. The change log should include the following ordered set of sections below that briefly summarise the features, updates and fixed issues of the release.

Here it is important to explain the benefit of each changelog item. As mentioned by James in a previous Slack message (https://tyktech.slack.com/archives/C044R3ZTN6L/p1686812207060839?thread_ts=1686762128.651249&cid=C044R3ZTN6L):
"...it is important to document the customer impact for the work delivered, so we can share it with prospects/install base. For example:
"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->

##### Added
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>OSS: Simplify Tyk Operator setup with Kubernetes Secret creation</summary>

When you set `operatorSecret.enabled` to `true` in the `tyk-oss` chart, a Kubernetes Secret named `tyk-operator-conf` will be automatically created in the same namespace. This secret is essential for connecting Tyk Operator to the Gateway, enabling seamless management of Tyk API resources. To learn more about setting up Tyk Operator, check out [Tyk Operator installation]({{<ref "/api-management/automations#install-and-configure-tyk-operator">}}).
</details>
</li>


<li>
<details>
<summary>MDCB: Enhanced analytics configuration options</summary>
We have introduced new configuration options for handling analytics data flow in MDCB deployments. By default, MDCB stores aggregated analytics data from the data plane pump to SQL/Mongo. Additionally, users have the flexibility to enable Pump in the control plane, allowing MDCB to send analytics to Redis instead.

Here are the default configurations:
```yaml 
mdcb:
  # When it is set to true, instead of sending analytics directly to MongoDB / SQL,
  # MDCB can send analytics to Redis. This will allow tyk-pump to pull
  # analytics from Redis and send to your own data sinks.
  # It is used to set TYK_MDCB_FORWARDANALYTICSTOPUMP
  forwardAnalyticsToPump: false

  # This enables saving analytics in multiple keys as oppose to just having one.
  # It is useful when using a Redis cluster.
  # It also only works when TYK_MDCB_FORWARDANALYTICSTOPUMP is set to true.
  enableMultipleAnalyticsKey: true

  # This should be set to true if you choose not to store selective analytics
  dontStoreSelective: false

  # This should be set to true if you choose not to store aggregate analytics
  dontStoreAggregate: false

  # If set to true then it will not store analytics for tags having prefix specified in the list.
  # NB: Prefix “key-” is added in the list by default. This tag is added by gateway for keys.
  ignoreTagPrefixList: []

  # If enabled, it will store analytics for all the endpoints, irrespective of Track Endpoint plugin.
  trackAllPaths: false

  # If enabled, aggregate data will be generated per minute.
  storeAnalyticsPerMinute: false   
```
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Tyk Control Plane: Added option to enable Dashboard hybrid organization</summary>
We've added a convenient option to enable dashboard hybrid organization during bootstrapping. This eliminates the manual step of calling the Dashboard Admin API post-deployment to enable hybrid organization, which is essential for MDCB deployment.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Enhanced security with customizable Pod or Container security context</summary>
To harden security, we have made security context of all Pods and Containers customizable. Also, we have set `runAsNonRoot: true` in all Pod's `securityContext`. This prevents the Pods from running as root users, ensuring compatibility with the [*Restricted* Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted).
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway: Allow Gateway to be updated if secret value is updated</summary>
We've introduced an annotation with a checksum of the secret as a value, triggering a deployment change when the secret is updated. This ensures that pods are replaced promptly, immediately utilizing the new values from the secret. This logic applies if `global.secrets.useSecretName` is not set, as the secret is then not part of the chart.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Customizable Pod Labels Across All Components</summary>
Now, you have the flexibility to customize Pod labels in all component charts. Simply populate the `podLabels` field with your desired content, and it will be added as pod labels.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Portal: Customizable Pod annotations in tyk-dev-portal</summary>
We've added a `podAnnotations` field to the `tyk-dev-portal` chart, allowing you to customize pod annotations. Fill in the `podAnnotations` field with your specific content, and it will be added as pod annotations.
</details>
</li>

</ul>

##### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:

- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the updated feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway/Pump: Removed the command in Gateway and Pump pod templates</summary>
We've removed unnecessary commands from the Gateway and Pump pod templates, allowing for the utilization of entrypoint scripts.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard: Allow arbitary image tags in tyk-dashboard</summary>
Now, you can use arbitrary image tags, including non-Semantic Versioning tags like `latest` for Dashboard. We've bypassed version checking in the Dashboard Deployment template to accommodate this flexibility.
</details>
</li>


<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard: Classic portal bootstrapping disabled by default</summary>
To avoid confusion with the latest Developer Portal, Classic Portal bootstrapping is now disabled by default in the Dashboard. If you wish to utilize the Classic Portal, simply enable it by setting `tyk-bootstrap.bootstrap.portal` to `true` in either the Tyk Stack or Tyk Control Plane chart.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard: Deprecation of `hashKeys` field</summary>
The `dashboard.hashKeys` field is now deprecated. Instead, users should utilize the `global.hashKeys` field to set key hashing. This ensures configuration alignment across Gateway, Dashboard, and MDCB components.
</details>
</li>

</ul>

##### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Global: Redis TLS version specification</summary>
We've corrected a typo in the values.yaml file within the "global.redis" section. The fields `sslMinVersion` and `sslMaxVersion` have been updated to `tlsMinVersion` and `tlsMaxVersion`, respectively. This ensures accurate specification of the Redis TLS version for enhanced security.
</details>
</li>

</ul>
