#### Changed

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Updated default versions of Tyk components</summary>

 Tyk Charts 2.2 will install the following Tyk component versions by default.

</li>

</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway: Corrected template name for OpenTelemetry caFilePath</summary>

Corrected the template name for the OpenTelemetry caFilePath in the Gateway configuration.
Updated template reference from `otel-CAPath` to `otel-tlsCAPath` to ensure proper functionality.
This fix addresses misconfigurations related to the OpenTelemetry TLS CA path and ensures accurate rendering of Gateway templates.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>MDCB: Fixed MDCB service configuration when using LoadBalancer as the service type</summary>

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Operator: Liveness and readiness probes failed due to deprecated ControllerManagerConfig CRD</summary>

Tyk Operator manifests used ControllerManagerConfig CRD to configure Operator Manager. However, the ControllerManagerConfig CRD has been deprecated in Tyk Operator v1.0 when we upgraded controller-runtime. Even though, operator runtime has default values for the configurations defined in CRD, deprecated CRD creates confusion for customers while deploying Tyk Operator.

This fix removed deprecated ControllerManagerConfig CRD from manifests and Operator runtime. It fixes liveness and readiness probes failure during upgrade.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Tyk Operator license key handling in tyk-oss chart</summary>

Resolved an issue where the Tyk OSS chart did not set the Operator license key in the secret created for the Operator. This fix ensures seamless configuration of the license key when deploying Tyk Operator. 
</details>
</li>

</ul>
