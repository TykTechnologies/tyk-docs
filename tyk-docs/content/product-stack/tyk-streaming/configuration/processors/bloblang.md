Executes a [Bloblang]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/guides/bloblang/overview" >}}) mapping on messages.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
bloblang: ""
```

[Bloblang]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/guides/bloblang/overview" >}}) is a powerful language that enables a wide range of mapping, transformation and filtering tasks.

If your mapping is large and you'd prefer for it to live in a separate file then you can execute a mapping directly from a file with the expression `from "<path>"`, where the path must be absolute, or relative from the location that Tyk Streams is executed from.

## Component Rename

<!-- TODO: add mapping processor and link to it -->
This processor was recently renamed to the [mapping processor]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/configuration/processors/mapping" >}}) in order to make the purpose of the processor more prominent. It is still valid to use the existing `bloblang` name but eventually it will be deprecated and replaced by the new name in example configs.

## Examples

### Mapping

Given JSON documents containing an array of fans:

```json
{
  "id":"foo",
  "description":"a show about foo",
  "fans":[
    {"name":"bev","obsession":0.57},
    {"name":"grace","obsession":0.21},
    {"name":"ali","obsession":0.89},
    {"name":"vic","obsession":0.43}
  ]
}
```

We can reduce the fans to only those with an obsession score above 0.5, giving us:

```json
{
  "id":"foo",
  "description":"a show about foo",
  "fans":[
    {"name":"bev","obsession":0.57},
    {"name":"ali","obsession":0.89}
  ]
}
```

With the following config:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - bloblang: |
      root = this
      root.fans = this.fans.filter(fan -> fan.obsession > 0.5)
```

### More Mapping

When receiving JSON documents of the form:

```json
{
  "locations": [
    {"name": "Seattle", "state": "WA"},
    {"name": "New York", "state": "NY"},
    {"name": "Bellevue", "state": "WA"},
    {"name": "Olympia", "state": "WA"}
  ]
}
```

We could collapse the location names from the state of Washington into a field `Cities`:

```json
{"Cities": "Bellevue, Olympia, Seattle"}
```

With the following config:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
        root.Cities = this.locations.
                        filter(loc -> loc.state == "WA").
                        map_each(loc -> loc.name).
                        sort().join(", ")
```

## Error Handling

[Bloblang]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/guides/bloblang/overview" >}}) mappings can fail, in which case the message remains unchanged, errors are logged, and the message is flagged as having failed, allowing you to use [standard processor error handling patterns]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/configuration/common-configuration/error-handling" >}}).

<!-- TODO add fallback link -->

<!-- However, [Bloblang]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/guides/bloblang/overview" >}}) itself also provides powerful ways of ensuring your mappings do not fail by specifying desired [fallback behavior]({{< ref "/product-stack/tyk-streaming/configuration/common-configuration/error-handling" >}}). -->
