"...it is important to document the customer impact for the work delivered, so we can share it with prospects/install base. For example:
"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->

#### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:
- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the updated feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.
Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Upgrade to Go 1.22 for Tyk Dashboard</summary>
The Tyk Dashboard has been upgraded from Golang 1.21 to Golang 1.22, bringing enhanced performance, strengthened security, and access to the latest features available in the new Golang release.
</details>
</li>
<li>
 <details>
 <summary>Introducing Distroless Containers for Tyk Dashboard (2024 LTS)</summary>
 
 In this release, we've enhanced the security of the Tyk Dashboard image by changing the build process to support [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) containers. This significant update addresses critical CVEs associated with Debian, ensuring a more secure and minimal runtime environment. Distroless containers reduce the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary packages, which bolsters the security of your deployments.
 </details>
 </li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway secret could be exposed in debug logs
</summary>

Resolved an issue where the Gateway secret was inadvertently included in the log generated by the Dashboard for a call to the `/api/keys` endpoint when in debug mode. This issue has been fixed to prevent sensitive information from appearing in system logs.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard didn't display correctly if more than 10 policies assigned to a key
</summary>

We have resolved an issue where the Keys page would display a blank screen if a key was associated with more than 10 policies. The UI has been fixed to display the page properly, regardless of the number of policies attached to a key.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard UI did not prevent multiple versions of a Tyk Classic API from being assigned to a policy</summary>

When working with Tyk Classic APIs, you cannot permit access to multiple versions of the same API from a single policy. We have fixed an issue in the Dashboard UI where users were able to attach multiple versions to a policy leading to an unusable policy. The UI now correctly prevents the addition of multiple versions of an API to a single policy.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard didn't correctly record scope to policy mappings for JWTs
</summary>

We have fixed an issue in the Dashboard UI when assigning multiple claim to policy mappings while configuring JWT auth for an API. The scope name was incorrectly recorded instead of the policy ID for the second and subsequent JWT scope mappings. The UI now correctly associates the defined claim with the appropriate policy, ensuring accurate JWT scope to policy mappings.
</details>
</li>

</ul>

#### Security Fixes
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that should be included when any security fixes have been made in the release, e.g. CVEs. For CVE fixes, consideration needs to be made as follows:
1. Dependency-tracked CVEs - External-tracked CVEs should be included on the release note.
2. Internal scanned CVEs - Refer to the relevant engineering and delivery policy.
For agreed CVE security fixes, provide a link to the corresponding entry on the NIST website. For example:
- Fixed the following CVEs:
    - [CVE-2022-33082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33082)
-->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>High priority CVEs fixed</summary>
Fixed the following high-priority CVEs identified in the Tyk Dashboard, providing increased protection against security vulnerabilities:
- [CVE-2024-6104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6104)
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Strengthened RBAC password reset permissions
</summary>

We have fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability where a user with certain permissions could reset any other users' password, potentially gaining control over admin accounts. The following changes have been made to tighten the behavior of the password reset permission within the Dashboard's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system:
- All users can reset their own passwords
- A specific permission is required to reset the password of another user within the same Tyk organization
- This permission can only be assigned by an admin or super-admin
- This permission can only be assigned to an admin and cannot be assigned to a user group
- The `allow_admin_reset_password` configuration option automatically grants this permission to all admin users
- Super-admins always have the password reset permission across all Tyk organizations
</details>
</li>
   
</ul>

</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added control over access to context variables from middleware when using Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

Addressed a potential issue when working with Tyk OAS APIs where request context variables are automatically made available to relevant Tyk and custom middleware. We have introduced a control in the Tyk OAS API definition to disable this access if required.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved PostgreSQL Dashboard Analytics issue</summary>

Fixed an issue in the api/usage endpoint where Dashboard+Postgres returned unfiltered results with one valid tag, requiring duplication of the parameter as a workaround for multiple tags. Analytics now correctly filter results as expected.

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.3.1}

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved security: user search method transitioned to POST</summary>

Improved the behavior of the Dashboard when searching for users to avoid transmitting sensitive information (user email addresses) in the request query parameters. Deprecated the `GET` method for the `/api/users/search` endpoint in favor of a `POST` method with the same logic but with parameters supplied in the request body.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved security: removal of Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header</summary>

As Tyk Dashboard and Tyk Classic Portal do not accept cross origin requests we have removed the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header from Dashboard API responses to prevent any potential misuse of the header by attackers. This allows simplification of the web application's security configuration.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved security: mitigation against brute force attacks based on login response time analysis</summary>

Implemented a randomised delay to obscure login response times, mitigating brute force attacks that rely on response time analysis.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved security: now unable to log into deleted Orgs</summary>

Fixed a bug where a user was still able to log into an Organization on the Tyk Dashboard after that Organization had been deleted. Now, when an Organization is deleted, it will not be offered as an option when logging in.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved security: suppressed accidental exposure of access keys to stdout</summary>

Fixed an issue where access keys could accidentally also be printed to the Dashboard's stdout when a call was made to `/api/keys` to retrieve the keys. This has now been suppressed.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Endpoint Designer does not handle wildcards in GraphQL policy allow/block lists</summary>

The Endpoint Designer did not correctly display a GraphQL policy's allow or block list if a wildcard character (`*`) was used in the list's definition. This has been fixed and now, if the wildcard (`*`) is present in the allow/block list definition, the UI correctly displays the list of allowed/blocked fields.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Open Policy Agent editor fails to open on Windows platform</summary>

Fixed an issue that was preventing the OPA editor from being visible using the keyboard shortcut when using Microsoft Windows.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Common keyboard shortcuts not working with UDG URL field in Data Graph Designer</summary>

Fixed an issue where common keyboard shortcuts (Cmd + X, A, C, V) were not working correctly when configuring the URL field for a UDG data source.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Unexplained HTTP 400 error reported in Tyk OAS API Designer</summary>

Fixed an issue in the Tyk OAS API Designer where there was no input validation of the OAuth Introspection URL. The Gateway reported an HTTP 400 error when attempting to save an API with an illegal value, however the API Designer did not guide the user to the source of the error. Now there is automatic validation of the text entered in the Introspection URL field.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Replaced the text editor used in Tyk Dashboard to address cursor issues</summary>

Fixed an issue with the text editor in the Tyk OAS API Designer where the cursor was misaligned with where characters would be entered. We have replaced the text editor module throughout the Tyk Dashboard to use a more modern, supported library.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Activity by Graph chart sometimes had display issues</summary>

The 'Top 5 Errors by Graph' bar chart in the Activity by Graph dashboard experienced display issues with long graph names and sometimes showed empty bars. This has been resolved, and the chart now displays accurately.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Analytics screens fail when too many requests are aggregated</summary>

Fixed a bug where some Tyk Dashboard analytics screens stopped working when the analytics aggregates collection grew too large.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Unable to delete APIs from DocumentDB storage</summary>

In [Tyk 5.2.2]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-dashboard/release-notes/version-5.2.md#Changelog-v5.2.2" >}}) we fixed an issue when using MongoDB and Tyk Security Policies where Tyk could incorrectly grant access to an API after that API had been deleted from the associated policy. This introduced an unintended side-effect for users of DocumentDB such that they were unable to delete APIs from the persistent storage. We identified that this was due to the use of the `$expr` operator in the solution - and discovered that this is supported by MongoDB but not by DocumentDB. We have now reimplemented the fix and removed the limitation introduced for DocumentDB users.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Unable to clear the API cache in distributed data plane Gateways from the control plane Dashboard</summary>

Addressed a bug where clearing the API cache from the Tyk Dashboard failed to invalidate the cache in distributed data plane gateways.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

## 5.3.0 Release Notes

### Release Date 5 April 2024

### Deployment Options for Tyk Dashboard

#### Tyk Cloud
Tyk Dashboard 5.3.0 is available on Tyk Cloud since 5th April 2024.

#### Self-Managed
This release is ready for installation on your own infrastructure.

### Breaking Changes

**Attention: Please read this section carefully.**

#### Tyk OAS APIs Compatibility Caveats {#TykOAS-v5.3.0}

This upgrade transitions Tyk OAS APIs out of [Early Access]({{< ref "developer-support/special-releases-and-features/early-access-features" >}}).

- **Out of Early access**
  - This means that from now on, all Tyk OAS APIs will be backwards compatible and in case of a downgrade from 5.3.X to 5.3.0, the Tyk OAS API definitions will always work.
- **Not Backwards Compatible**
  - Tyk OAS APIs in Tyk Dashboard v5.3.0 are not [backwards compatible](https://tinyurl.com/3xy966xn). This means that the new Tyk OAS API format used by Tyk Gateway/Dashboard v5.3.X does not work with older versions of Tyk Gateway/Dashboard, i.e. you cannot export these API definitions from a v5.3.X Tyk Dashboard and import to an earlier version.
  - The upgrade of Tyk OAS API definitions is **not reversible**, i.e. you cannot use version 5.3.X Tyk OAS API definitions with an older version of Tyk Dashboard.
  - This means that if you wish to downgrade or revert to your previous version of Tyk, you will need to restore these API definitions from a backup. Please go to the [backup]({{< ref "#upgrade-instructions" >}}) section for detailed instructions on backup before upgrading to v5.3.0.
  - When using MongoDB as your persistent data store, Tyk OAS APIs from v5.3.0 require a minimum version of MongoDB 5.0.
  - If you are not using Tyk OAS APIs, Tyk will maintain backward compatibility standards.
- **Not Forward Compatible**
  - Tyk OAS API Definitions prior to v5.3.0 are not [forward compatible](https://tinyurl.com/t3zz88ep) with Tyk Gateway v5.3.X.
  - This means that any Tyk OAS APIs created in any previous release (4.1.0-5.2.x) cannot work with the new Tyk Dashboard v5.3.X without being migrated to its [latest format]({{<ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc">}}).
- **MDCB deployment and Tyk OAS APIs**
  - Tyk OAS APIs created in Tyk v5.3.0 will not be loaded by the data plane gateways if you are using MDCB v2.4 or older. This means that MDCB users already working with Tyk OAS APIs **must wait for the release of MDCB v2.5** before upgrading Tyk Gateway and Dashboard to v5.3.0. 
  - Tyk Dashboard v5.3.0 managing Tyk OAS APIs requires Tyk Gateway v5.3.0 and MDCB v2.5.X for proper functionality. Older versions of Tyk Gateway may experience compatibility issues with Tyk OAS API definitions from v5.3.0.
- **After upgrade (the good news)**
  - If you had a Tyk OAS API prior to v5.3.0 then Tyk Dashboard will automatically update the API definition to [latest format]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc" >}}).
  - This means that you do not have to do anything to make your Tyk OAS APIs compatible with the new 5.3.0 release as Tyk Dashboard will take care of that during start-up.
  - As mentioned above, this upgrade of Tyk OAS API definitions is irreversible.
  
**Important:** Please go to the [backup]({{< ref "#upgrade-instructions" >}}) section for essential instructions on how to backup before upgrading to v5.3.0
 
### Dependencies {#dependencies-5.3.0}
<!--Required. Use this section to announce the following types of dependencies compatible with the release:

#### API Templates

Exclusively for Tyk OAS APIs, we are pleased to announce the introduction of API Templates: an API governance feature provided to streamline the process of creating APIs. An API template is an asset managed by Tyk Dashboard that is used as the starting point - a blueprint - from which you can create a new Tyk OAS API definition. With templates you can standardize configuration of your APIs more easily, combining your service-specific OpenAPI descriptions with enterprise requirements such as health endpoints, caching and authorization.

#### Enhanced User Permissions

 Introducing allow list in field-based permissions via the Dashboard specifically tailored for GraphQL APIs. Users can now define granular access control for API key holders based on types and fields from a GraphQL schema. This feature enhances security and flexibility in managing API access, providing a more tailored and secure experience for users.

 #### Global Header Management 

 We've introduced global header management specifically for UDG, simplifying header configuration across all data sources. Users can now effortlessly add, adjust, and delete multiple global headers, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout API management, ultimately saving developers time and effort

#### GraphQL focused analytics
We have made the first step towards bringing our users GraphQL-focused monitoring capabilities. Users can now gain valuable insights into error trends and usage patterns for GraphQL APIs, when storing graph analytics in SQL databases. With the addition of popularity and error bar charts, users can delve deeper into their data, facilitating optimization and troubleshooting efforts.

#### Redis v7.x Compatibility
We have upgraded Redis driver [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) to v9. Subsequently, Tyk 5.3 is compatible with Redis v7.x.

#### MongoDB v7.0.x Compatibility
We have upgraded `mongo-go` driver to [mongo-go v1.13.1](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases/tag/v1.13.1). It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB. We have also tested that both Tyk 5.0.x+ and Tyk 5.3 are compatible with MongoDB v7.0.x.

<summary>Implemented Design Elements for GraphQL Permissions</summary>

Support for field-based permissions allow list has been added in the Dashboard. Users can now define which types and fields from a GraphQL schema an API key holder can access by simply putting a tick next to them in the policy/key definition screens.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added API Categories support for Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

In this update, we've added support for API Categories for Tyk OAS APIs in the Tyk Dashboard, enhancing portfolio management by enabling efficient categorization and organization of APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added API Ownership support for Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

We’ve extended the API ownership capabilities of Tyk Dashboard to Tyk OAS APIs. This feature allows you to manage visibility of APIs deployed on the Dashboard, streamlining governance processes and enhancing internal security.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added API Templates for Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

Extended Tyk Dashboard API to support CRUD operations on API Templates, enabling users to create, apply, and manage templates programmatically.

Added Dashboard UI functionality for creation and management of API Templates, including the ability to create templates from existing Tyk OAS APIs. You can apply templates during API creation, including when importing OpenAPI documents. Access to API templates is controlled through the introduction of a new user permission.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Import OpenAPI Documents from File or URL</summary>

Now you can import the OpenAPI description from a file or URL when creating or updating your Tyk OAS APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Introduced Global Header Management for GraphQL </summary>

Access the new Global Header Management feature directly through the Headers Management tab. Swiftly add and configure multiple global headers or remove them with a single click, ensuring they're forwarded to all GraphQL data sources. This enhancement streamlines header management, providing a more user-friendly experience.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added monitoring capabilities for GraphQL APIs in the Dashboard</summary>

We’ve enabled basic Graph monitoring in the Dashboard. Due to the specificity of GQL APIs, monitoring them as you would REST, is not enough. One endpoint vs multiple endpoints, multiple queries/mutations vs HTTP methods, errors that happen not only in HTTP layer but also come back in response body - that all makes monitoring GQL slightly more complex than just looking at request and error rates.

A new section of the Dashboard offers the following information:
- top 5 most popular graphs and operations requested within them within a specified period of time
- top 5 graphs with errors within a specified period of time
- summary of number of requests, number of successful responses, number of errors, average latency and last access date within a specified period of time for all graphs
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Support MongoDB v7.0.x</summary>

Tyk 5.3 integrates with [storage v1.2.2](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/storage), which updated mongo-go driver we use from v1.11.2 to [mongo-go v1.13.1](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases/tag/v1.13.1). It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB. We have also tested that Tyk 5.0.x+ is compatible with MongoDB v7.0.x 
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Support Redis v7.0.x</summary>
 
Tyk 5.3 refactors Redis connection logic by using [storage v1.2.2](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/storage/releases/tag/v1.2.2), which integrates with [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) v9. Subsequently, support now exists for Redis v7.0.x.

</ul>

  
#### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:

- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the updated feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enhanced Dashboard Navigation: Introducing Favorite Screens</summary>

Every Dashboard menu item can now be flagged as a favorite so that it is pinned to the top of the menu navigation bar for easier access. We've also made a few changes in styling, so that the navigation menu is nicer to look at.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved UI for GraphQL Data Source Headers Management</summary>

We have moved data source header management to a separate tab, so that it is easy to configure global headers that will be forwarded to all data sources by default. The data source configuration screen displays all headers that will be sent with the upstream request in read-only mode now and changes can be made by switching to Headers Management tab.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Go 1.21 upgrade for Dashboard</summary>

We have updated Tyk Dashboard to use Go 1.21, matching the upgrade in Tyk Gateway 1.21. Remember to recompile any custom Go plugins with the matching version of Go to avoid incompatibility problems.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>The internal TIB session secret defaults to admin_secret if it is not set explicitly</summary>

If internal TIB is enabled in Dashboard and the TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET environment variable is not set, it will be default to Dashboard admin_secret. It provides better security and user experience because SSO flow would not work if TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET is not set.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Set default MongoDB driver to mongo-go</summary>

Tyk uses `mongo-go` as the default MongoDB driver from v5.3. This provides support for MongoDB 4.4.x, 5.0.x, 6.0.x and 7.0.x. If you are using older MongoDB versions e.g. 3.x, please set MongoDB driver to `mgo`. The [MongoDB supported versions](https://tyk.io/docs/planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb/#supported-versions) page provides details on how to configure MongoDB drivers in Tyk.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved OPA rule restriction on UDG OAS import endpoint</summary>

We fixed an issue where OPA rules were preventing users from importing an OpenAPI document as a UDG data source using the /api/data-graphs/data-sources/import endpoint. The endpoint has now been included into the correct user permission group and will be accessible for users who have `api:write` permissions.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimized Policy Creation Endpoint</summary>

Fixed an issue where applying security policies to large numbers of APIs took a long time. We’ve implemented bulk processing in the validation step at the api/portal/policies/POLICY_ID endpoint, resulting in an 80% reduction in the time taken to apply a policy to 2000 APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Security for Classic Portal</summary>

Moved all HTML inline scripts to their own script files, to accommodate the content security policies that have been enabled, to increase security.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Errors importing larger OpenAPI Documents</summary>

Fixed an issue when importing reasonably large OpenAPI documents via the Dashboard would fail due to MongoDB storage limitation of 16 MB per document.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Removed the need for a Description to be provided in the OpenAPI schema when autogenerating a Tyk OAS mock response</summary>

Relaxed the strict validation for mock response so that the `Description` field is now optional for `response`, `responses` and `schema` within the OpenAPI description. Automatically configuring mock responses when using [Tyk OAS APIs]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/mock-response-openapi" >}}) is now even easier.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed SSO flow for Classic Developer Portal</summary>

For Classic Portal cookies and Dashboard, use `SameSite = SameSiteLaxMode` so that SSO flows can be performed
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Remove unnecessary warning output from `tyk-dashboard --version`</summary>
   
Remove the following unnecessary warning output when users use the `tyk-dashboard --version` command to check dashboard version. 
> `WARN toth/tothic: no TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET environment variable is set. The default cookie store is not available and any calls will fail. Ignore this warning if you are using a different store.`
</details>
</li>  
</ul>
