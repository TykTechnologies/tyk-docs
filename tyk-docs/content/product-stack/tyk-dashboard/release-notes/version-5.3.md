## 5.3.0 Release Notes

### Release Date DD Mon YYYY <<update>>

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Required. Use the following statement if there are no breaking changes, or explain if there are -->
**Attention: Please read this section carefully.**

As Tyk OAS transitions out of [Early Access]({{< ref "frequently-asked-questions/using-early-access-features" >}}), we cannot guarantee backward compatibility for versions pre-5.3.0. When upgrading to 5.3.0, Tyk will automatically migrate existing Tyk OAS APIs to the [latest API definition format]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc" >}}).
Tyk OAS APIs using the 5.3.0 API definition may not work with pre-5.3.0 versions of Tyk Gateway and doing so could provoke unpredictable behaviour including potential crashes. We recommend retaining copies of existing Tyk OAS API definitions before upgrading in case you choose to downgrade later.
Users are strongly advised to follow the recommended upgrade instructions provided by Tyk before applying any updates.

- Security
    - All Tyk-supported client-gateway authentication methods including custom auth plugins
    - Automatic configuration of authentication from the OpenAPI description
    - Gateway-upstream mTLS
    - CORS
  
- API-level (global) middleware including:
    - Response caching
    - Custom plugins for PreAuth, Auth, PostAuth, Post and Response hooks
    - API-level rate limits
    - Request transformation - headers
    - Response transformation - headers
    - Service discovery
    - Internal API

- Endpoint-level (per-path) middleware including:
    - Request validation - headers and body (automatically configurable from the OpenAPI description)
    - Request transformation - method, headers and body
    - Response transformation - headers and body
    - URL rewrite and internal endpoints
    - Mock responses (automatically configurable from the OpenAPI description)
    - Response caching
    - Custom Go Post-Plugin
    - Request size limit

#### API Templates

Exclusively for Tyk OAS APIs, we are pleased to announce the introduction of API Templates: an API governance feature provided to streamline the process of creating APIs. An API template is an asset managed by Tyk Dashboard that is used as the starting point - a blueprint - from which you can create a new Tyk OAS API definition. With templates you can standardise configuration of your APIs more easily, combining your service-specific OpenAPI descriptions with enterprise requirements such as health endpoints, caching and authorisation.

#### Enhanced User Permissions

 Introducing field-based permissions via the Dashboard specifically tailored for GraphQL APIs. Users can now define granular access control for API key holders based on types and fields from a GraphQL schema. This feature enhances security and flexibility in managing API access, providing a more tailored and secure experience for users.

 #### Global Header Management 

 We've introduced global header management specifically for UDG, simplifying header configuration across all data sources. Users can now effortlessly add, adjust, and delete multiple global headers, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout API management, ultimately saving developers time and effort

#### Enhanced Analytics
We have expanded our analytics capabilities by extending APIs for fetching graph analytics from SQL databases. Users can now gain valuable insights into error trends and usage patterns for GraphQL APIs. With the addition of popularity and error bar charts, users can delve deeper into their data, facilitating optimization and troubleshooting efforts.

#### Redis v7.x Compatibility
We have upgraded redis driver [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) to v9. Subsequently, Tyk 5.3 is compatible with Redis v7.x.

#### MongoDB v7.0.x Compatibility
We have upgraded mongo-go driver to [mongo-go v1.13.1](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases/tag/v1.13.1). It allows us to benefit from the bug fixes and enhancements released by MongoDB. We have also tested that both Tyk 5.0.x+ and Tyk 5.3 are compatible with MongoDB v7.0.x.

#### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:

- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the updated feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enhanced Dashboard Navigation: Introducing Favourite Screens</summary>

Every Dashboard menu item can now be flagged as a favourite so that it is pinned to the top of the menu navigation bar for easier access. We've also made a few changes in styling, so that the navigation menu is nicer to look at.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved UI for GraphQL Data Source Headers Management</summary>

We have moved data source header management to a separate tab, so that it is easy to configure global headers that will be forwarded to all data sources by default. The data source configuration screen displays all headers that will be sent with the upstream request in read-only mode now and changes can be made by switching to Headers Management tab.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Go 1.21 upgrade for Dashboard</summary>

We have updated Tyk Dashboard to use Go 1.21, matching the upgrade in Tyk Gateway 1.21. Remember to recompile any custom Go plugins with the matching version of Go to avoid incompatibility problems.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>The internal TIB session secret defaults to admin_secret if it is not set explicitly</summary>

If internal TIB is enabled in Dashboard and the TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET environment variable is not set, it will be default to Dashboard admin_secret. It provides better security and user experience because SSO flow would not work if TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET is not set.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Set default MongoDB driver to mongo-go</summary>

Tyk uses `mongo-go` as the default MongoDB driver from v5.3. This provides support for MongoDB 4.4.x, 5.0.x, 6.0.x and 7.0.x. If you are using older MongoDB versions e.g. 3.x, please set MongoDB driver to `mgo`. The [MongoDB supported versions](https://tyk.io/docs/planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb/#supported-versions) page provides details on how to configure MongoDB drivers in Tyk.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved OPA rule restriction on UDG OAS import endpoint</summary>

We fixed an issue where OPA rules were preventing users from importing an OpenAPI document as a UDG data source using the /api/data-graphs/data-sources/import endpoint. The endpoint has now been included into the correct user permission group and will be accessible for users who have `api:write` permissions.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimised Policy Creation Endpoint</summary>

Fixed an issue where applying security policies to large numbers of APIs took a long time. We’ve implemented bulk processing in the validation step at the api/portal/policies/POLICY_ID endpoint, resulting in an 80% reduction in the time taken to apply a policy to 2000 APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Security for Classic Portal</summary>

Moved all HTML inline scripts to their own script files, to accommodate the content security policies that have been enabled, to increase security.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Errors importing larger OpenAPI Documents</summary>

Fixed an issue when importing reasonably large OpenAPI documents via the Dashboard would fail due to MongoDB storage limitation of 16 MB per document.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed SSO flow for Classic Developer Portal</summary>

For Classic Portal cookies and Dashboard, use `SameSite = SameSiteLaxMode` so that SSO flows can be performed
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Remove unnecessary warning output from `tyk-dashboard --version`</summary>
   
Remove the following unnecessary warning output when users use the `tyk-dashboard --version` command to check dashboard version. 
> `WARN toth/tothic: no TYK_IB_SESSION_SECRET environment variable is set. The default cookie store is not available and any calls will fail. Ignore this warning if you are using a different store.`
