This release primarily focuses on bug fixes.
For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-vX.Y.0">}}) below.
-->
We are thrilled to announce new updates and improvements in Tyk 5.6.0, bringing more control, flexibility, and performance.  For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-v5.6.0">}}) below.

#### Per endpoint Rate Limiting for clients

Now you can configure rate limits at the [endpoint level per client]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting" >}}), using new configuration options in the access key. Use Tyk's powerful [security policies]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy" >}}) to create templates to set appropriate rate limits for your different categories of user.

#### Go upgrade to 1.22

We’ve upgraded the Tyk Dashboard to Golang 1.22, bringing improved performance, better security, and enhanced stability to the core system.

####  Strengthened Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) to combat privilege escalation risks

We’ve tightened up the rules that govern a user's ability to create admin users and to reset other users' passwords when using Tyk's RBAC function. Now, only super-admins can create new admins, admin roles can't be assigned to user groups, and only admin users can reset another user's password (and only within their Tyk organization).

### Deprecations
<!-- Required. Use the following statement if there are no deprecations, or explain if there are -->

We are deprecating support for SQLite, External OAuth Middleware, and OpenID Connect (OIDC) Middleware in Tyk Dashboard to simplify the platform and enhance overall performance. These changes will take effect from 5.7.0.

### Why the Change?

### SQLite

While useful for testing, SQLite is not designed for production environments. By focusing on PostgreSQL and MongoDB, we can provide users with more scalable and reliable options.

### External OAuth Middleware

This feature serves a similar purpose to our JWT Authentication and may lead to confusion. We recommend transitioning to JWT Authentication for a more streamlined experience.

### OpenID Connect (OIDC) Middleware 

The low adoption of this option, along with its functional overlap with other supported authentication methods, prompts us to deprecate OIDC middleware to reduce complexity within the platform. We recommend users transition to JWT Authentication.


We encourage users to switch to the recommended alternatives. For more detailed information, please refer to the [Documentation](https://tyk.io/docs//api-management/client-authentication#integrate-with-openid-connect-deprecated/) 


<!-- Optional section!
Used to share and notify users about our plan to deprecate features, configs etc.
Once you put an item in this section, we must keep this item listed in all the following releases till the deprecation happens. -->

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.6.0}
<!-- Required. The change log should include the following ordered set of sections below that briefly summarise the features, updates and fixed issues of the release.
Here it is important to explain the benefit of each changelog item. As mentioned by James in a previous Slack message (https://tyktech.slack.com/archives/C044R3ZTN6L/p1686812207060839?thread_ts=1686762128.651249&cid=C044R3ZTN6L):

<summary>Per endpoint client rate limiting</summary>

Building on the [per-endpoint upstream rate limits]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#api-level-rate-limiting" >}}) introduced in Tyk 5.5.0 we have now added [per-endpoint client rate limits]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting" >}}). This new feature allows for more granular control over client consumption of API resources by associating the rate limit with the access key, enabling you to manage and optimize API usage more effectively.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard didn't display correctly if more than 10 policies assigned to a key</summary>

We have resolved an issue where the Keys page would display a blank screen if a key was associated with more than 10 policies. The UI has been fixed to display the page properly, regardless of the number of policies attached to a key.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard UI did not prevent multiple versions of a Tyk Classic API from being assigned to a policy</summary>

When working with Tyk Classic APIs, you cannot permit access to multiple versions of the same API from a single policy. We have fixed an issue in the Dashboard UI where users were able to attach multiple versions to a policy leading to an unusable policy. The UI now correctly prevents the addition of multiple versions of an API to a single policy.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard didn't correctly record scope to policy mappings for JWTs</summary>

We have fixed an issue in the Dashboard UI when assigning multiple claim to policy mappings while configuring JWT auth for an API. The scope name was incorrectly recorded instead of the policy ID for the second and subsequent JWT scope mappings. The UI now correctly associates the defined claim with the appropriate policy, ensuring accurate JWT scope to policy mappings.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway logs page not displaying correctly</summary>

We have fixed an issue in the Monitoring section of the Dashboard UI where the *Gateway logs* page was not displaying correctly. The page is now rendered properly, ensuring users with appropriate permissions can view and manage *Gateway logs* as expected.

</details>
