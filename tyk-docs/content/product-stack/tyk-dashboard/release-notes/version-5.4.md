-->
We're thrilled to introduce exciting enhancements in Tyk Dashboard 5.4, aimed at improving your experience with Tyk Dashboard. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the change log below.

### Event handling for Tyk OAS APIs

We’ve added support for you to register webhooks with your Tyk OAS APIs so that you can handle events triggered by the Gateway, including circuit breaker and quota expiry. You can also assign webhooks to be fired when using the new smoothing rate limiter to notify your systems of ongoing traffic spikes. For more details see the [documentation]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/report-monitor-trigger-events/webhooks" >}}).

### Enhanced Header Handling in GraphQL APIs

Introduced a features object in API definitions for GQL APIs, including the `use_immutable_headers` attribute. This allows advanced header control, enabling users to add new headers, rewrite existing ones, and selectively remove specific headers. Existing APIs will have this attribute set to `false` by default, ensuring no change in behavior. For new APIs, this attribute is true by default, facilitating smoother migration and maintaining backward compatibility.

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.4.0}
<!-- Required. The change log should include the following ordered set of sections below that briefly summarise the features, updates and fixed issues of the release.
Here it is important to explain the benefit of each changelog item. As mentioned by James in a previous Slack message (https://tyktech.slack.com/archives/C044R3ZTN6L/p1686812207060839?thread_ts=1686762128.651249&cid=C044R3ZTN6L):
"...it is important to document the customer impact for the work delivered, so we can share it with prospects/install base. For example:
"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->
#### Added
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:
- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.
Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Introduced Rate Limit Smoothing for Redis Rate Limiter</summary>

Implemented a [rate limit smoothing mechanism]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#rate-limit-smoothing" >}}) to gradually adjust the rate limit as the request rate increases and decreases between an intermediate threshold and the maximum rate limit. New `RateLimitSmoothingUp` and `RateLimitSmoothingDown` events will be triggered as this smoothing occurs, supporting auto-scaling of upstream capacity. The smoothing process gradually increases the rate, thereby unblocking clients that exceed the current request rate in a staggered manner.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Updated API designer toolbar for GraphQL and Universal Data Graph</summary>

Revamped the API designer toolbar for GraphQL and Universal Data Graph, consolidating all relevant actions for each API type under a single menu dropdown for improved usability.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Updated API designer toolbar for HTTP and TCP</summary>

Revamped the API designer toolbar for HTTP and TCP, consolidating all relevant actions for each API type under a single menu dropdown for improved usability.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>New Tyk OAS features</summary>

We’ve added some more features to the Tyk OAS API, moving closer to full parity with Tyk Classic. In this release we’ve added controls that allow you: to enable or prevent generation of traffic logs at the API-level; to enable or prevent the availability of session context to middleware and to pin public key certificates to an API. We’ve also added the facility to register webhooks that will be fired in response to Gateway events.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>New Dashboard API endpoints</summary>

We have added a new `/oas/dry-run` endpoint to the Tyk Dashboard API. This uses the Dashboard’s logic to create or update a Tyk OAS API definition using an OpenAPI document without instantiating the API on the Tyk platform.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:
- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.
Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed template inheritance issue in API Designer</summary>

Resolved a bug in the API Designer where certain properties, such as `use_immutable_headers`, were not correctly inherited from the new API template. This fix ensures all default settings from the template are properly applied when creating a new API.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Corrected assignment issue for API Templates in Tyk organizations</summary>

Fixed an issue where API Templates were not correctly assigned to Tyk Organizations, preventing potential accidental sharing of secret data between Organizations through the use of incorrect templates.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Addressed keyboard shortcut issues in Universal Data Graph URL field configuration</summary>

Fixed an issue where common keyboard shortcuts (Cmd + X, A, C, V) were not functioning correctly when configuring the URL field for a UDG data source.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Streamlined data source import endpoint in Dashboard API</summary>

Improved the data source import endpoint in the Dashboard API by removing the need for users to convert OpenAPI/AsyncAPI documents into strings before submission. Users can now provide the documents directly, enhancing the overall user experience.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enhanced password reset security</summary>

Modified default OPA rules to fix an issue where admins were unable to reset their own password. Tyk Dashboard clients using custom OPA rules should update their rule set accordingly. Contact your assigned Tyk representative for assistance.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Corrected filtering for Dashboard Analytics with PostgreSQL</summary>

Addressed an issue in the api/usage endpoint where Dashboard analytics with PostgreSQL returned unfiltered results. The endpoint now correctly filters results, eliminating the need for duplicating parameters to handle multiple tags.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Minor Dashboard UI fixes and improvements </summary>

We have made some improvements to the wording used in the Dashboard user interface and fixed some minor usability issues.
</details>
</li>
</ul>
