We are thrilled to announce new updates and improvements in Tyk 5.7.0, bringing more control, flexibility, and performance.  For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-v5.7.0" >}}) below.

#### Tyk Streams can be configured through Tyk Dashboard

With this release we are adding a possibility for users to configure their Stream & Events APIs using Tyk Dashboard. 
The new API designer leads users step-by-step to create a new Stream configuration easily. Pre-filled stream configurations for different inputs and outputs make it easy to make sure that the Stream is configured correctly.

#### Improved Audit Log Management

Tyk 5.7.0 enhances Audit Log management with new features designed for efficiency and security. Users can now store Dashboard Audit Logs in a database for persistent retention and access them via the new /audit-logs API, which supports advanced filtering by attributes like action, IP, status, and user. Additionally, a dedicated Audit Log RBAC group ensures secure access to sensitive log data. These improvements simplify monitoring and compliance workflows, particularly in containerized environments.

### Deprecations
<!-- Required. Use the following statement if there are no deprecations, or explain if there are -->
In 5.7.0, we have deprecated the dedicated [External OAuth]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/ext-oauth-middleware" >}})  (Tyk Classic: `external_oauth`, Tyk OAS: `server.authentication.securitySchemes.externalOAuth`) and [OpenID Connect]({{< ref "api-management/client-authentication#integrate-with-openid-connect-deprecated" >}})  (Tyk Classic: `auth_configs.oidc`, Tyk OAS: `server.authentication.oidc`) authentication methods. We advise users to switch to [JWT Authentication]({{< ref "api-management/client-authentication#use-json-web-tokens-jwt" >}}).

Additionally, SQLite has reached its End of Life in this release, enabling a fully static, CGO-free Tyk Dashboard optimised for RHEL8. Sqlite was previously recommended only to be used in basic proofs of concept. Now, for such scenarios and for production, we recommend migrating to PostgreSQL or MongoDB for better scalability and support.
<!-- Optional section!
Used to share and notify users about our plan to deprecate features, configs etc.
Once you put an item in this section, we must keep this item listed in all the following releases till the deprecation happens. -->
