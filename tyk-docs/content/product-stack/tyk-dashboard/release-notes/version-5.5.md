#### Added
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.
Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Configure the new endpoint level rate limits in API Designer</summary>

Rate limits can now be configured at the endpoint level in Tyk OAS and Tyk Classic API definitions. Configure these new more granular controls from the API Designer. 
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved handling of requests to non-existent versions of APIs when using URL path versioning</summary>

When configuring API versioning settings for Tyk OAS APIs, you can now set a *Version Identifier Pattern* when using the URL path to indicate the API version (for example `/v1/my-api`). This will be used to avoid accidentally stripping part of the target URL (and failed upstream proxy) if the client doesn't provide any version identifier. If you're using Tyk Classic APIs you can set the `url_versioning_pattern` field in the API definition using the raw API editor.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved schema editor functionality for GQL APIs</summary>

We've expanded the functionality of the schema editor for GQL APIs. Users can now easily import their schema from a file, export it, or quickly clean the entire editor if a mistake is made.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Changed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Updated NPM packages dependencies</summary>

Updated npm package dependencies of Dashboard, to address security vulnerabilities.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:
- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.
Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved an issue seen when using reponse plugins with Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

Addressed a problem where Response Plugins were not being invoked for Tyk OAS APIs.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Save API button now visible for SSO users</summary>

Addressed an issue for SSO users where user permissions were not correctly applied. This led to the Save API button not being visible to all appropriate users in the API Designer.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Public playground schema exposure fixed with Introspection disabled</summary>

Resolved an issue where the Public GQL Playground displayed schema information despite introspection being turned off. Now, schema details are hidden unless valid authentication credentials are provided, ensuring a secure and consistent user experience.
</details>
</li>
<li>
 <details>
 <summary>Resolved issue with no analytics data showing on Endpoint Popularity page</summary>

Addressed an issue where the Dashboard displayed a blank pane when accessing the Activity by Endpoint page after upgrading to Tyk 5.3.1.
 </details>
