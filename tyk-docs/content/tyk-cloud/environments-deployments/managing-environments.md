## Introduction

Environments are used to group your [Control Plane]({{< ref "#glossary" >}}) and [Cloud Data Planes]({{< ref "#glossary" >}}) into logical groups. For example you may want to create environments that reflect different departments of your organization.

**Note**

The number of Environments you can create is determined by your [plan]({{< ref "#select-a-payment-plan" >}})
