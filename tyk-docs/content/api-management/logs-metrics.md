## Introduction

API observability is the process of monitoring and analyzing APIs to gain insights into developer and end-user experience and to ensure the reliability of your system.

You can achieve API observability by using a combination of telemetry signals such as traces, metrics, and logs. Each of these signals serves a specific purpose in monitoring and troubleshooting API issues:

### Distributed Tracing

Distributed traces provide a detailed, end-to-end view of a single API request or transaction as it traverses through various services and components. Traces are crucial for understanding the flow of requests and identifying bottlenecks or latency issues. Here's how you can make use of traces for API observability:

- **End-to-end request tracing:** Implement distributed tracing across your microservices architecture to track requests across different services and gather data about each service's contribution to the overall request latency.
    
- **Transaction Flow:** Visualize the transaction flow by connecting traces to show how requests move through different services, including entry points (e.g., API gateway), middleware and backend services.
    
- **Latency Analysis:** Analyze trace data to pinpoint which service or component is causing latency issues, allowing for quick identification and remediation of performance bottlenecks.
    
- **Error Correlation:** Use traces to correlate errors across different services to understand the root cause of issues and track how errors propagate through the system.
    

From v5.2+, Tyk supports OpenTelemetry standard for tracing. You can configure Tyk to work with an [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) or integrate it with any [observability vendor supporting OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/) to capture traces of API requests as they flow through Tyk API Gateway and any upstream services.

Explore our guides for [Datadog]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#datadog" >}}), [Dynatrace]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#dynatrace" >}}), [Jaeger]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#using-docker" >}}) and [New Relic]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#new-relic" >}}) for further info on how to integrate with 3rd party observability vendors.

Tyk also supports OpenTracing (now deprecated), but we recommend users to start migrating to OpenTelemetry for a comprehensive, vendor-neutral technology with wide industry support.

### Metrics

Metrics provide aggregated, quantitative data about the performance and behavior of an API over time. They offer insights into the overall health of the system. Here's how you can leverage metrics for API observability:

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Define and track essential metrics such as request rate, response time, error rate and resource utilization to monitor the overall health and performance of the API.
    
- **Custom Metrics:** Create custom metrics that are specific to your API's functionality or business objectives. For example, track the number of successful payments processed or the number of users signed up.
    
- **Threshold Alerts:** Set up alerts based on predefined thresholds for metrics to receive notifications when API performance deviates from the expected norm.
    
- **Trend Analysis:** Analyze metric trends over time to identify long-term performance patterns, plan for scaling and detect anomalies.
    

Tyk offers built-in metrics and analytics in [Tyk Dashboard]({{<ref "api-management/dashboard-configuration#traffic-analytics">}}) through Tyk API Gateway and Tyk Pump. These metrics provide insights into API usage, traffic patterns and response times. The built-in metrics allow you to track overall API traffic, detailed API analytics including: request count, response time distribution and error rates. Furthermore, API usage can be tracked on a per-key basis.

You can also use Tyk Pump to export those metrics to [different back-ends]({{<ref "api-management/tyk-pump#external-data-stores">}}). Here is an example of using Tyk Pump to send [API analytics metrics to Prometheus and Grafana](https://tyk.io/blog/service-level-objectives-for-your-apis-with-tyk-prometheus-and-grafana/). From v5.2+, you can also leverage the OpenTelemetry spans exported from Tyk Gateway to calculate and export [span metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/connector/spanmetricsconnector/README.md) from the OpenTelemetry collector.

### Logs

Logs provide detailed records of events and activities within the API and its associated services. Logs are invaluable for debugging issues and understanding what happened at a specific point in time. Here's how you can utilize logs for API observability:

- **Error Identification:** Use logs to identify errors, exceptions, and warning messages that indicate issues with the API's behavior.
    
- **Debugging:** Logs help developers troubleshoot and debug issues by providing detailed information about the sequence of events leading up to a problem.
    
- **Security Monitoring:** Monitor logs for security-related events, such as authentication failures, access control violations and suspicious activities.
    
- **Audit Trail:** Maintain an audit trail of important actions and changes to the API, including configuration changes, access control changes and data updates.
    

Tyk allows you to capture and analyze logs related to API requests and responses in the [Log Browser]({{<ref "api-management/dashboard-configuration#activity-logs">}}) . You can optionally enable detailed recording for the requests per API level or per Key level to store inbound request and outbound response data. You can [enable debug modes]({{<ref "api-management/troubleshooting-debugging#capturing-detailed-logs">}}) for selected APIs and send the detail logs to one or more Pump backend instances.

To achieve comprehensive API observability, it is essential to integrate traces, metrics and logs into the observability tools that the team in charge of the APIs are already using. Those tools should allow users to query and visualize data, set up alerts and provide an intuitive interface for monitoring and troubleshooting API issues effectively. See also our 7 observability anti-pattern to avoid when working with APIs: [Bad API observability](https://tyk.io/blog/bad-api-observability/).


## Metric Collection

Metrics collection and analysis are key components of an Observability strategy, providing real-time insight into system behaviour and performance.

Tyk Gateway, Pump and Dashboard have been instrumented for [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) monitoring.

Additionally, Tyk Gateway has also been instrumented for [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com) metrics.

### StatsD Instrumentation

StatsD is a network daemon that listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP or TCP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services. It's a simple yet powerful tool for collecting and aggregating application metrics.

#### Configuring StatsD instrumentation

To enable instrumentation for StatsD, you must set the environment variable: `TYK_INSTRUMENTATION=1` and then configure the `statsd_connection_string` field for each component.

`statsd_connection_string` is a formatted string that specifies how to connect to the StatsD server. It typically includes information such as the host address, port number, and sometimes additional configuration options.

Optionally you can set `statsd_prefix` to a custom prefix value that will be applied to each metric generated by Tyk. For example, you can configure separate prefixes for your production and staging environments to make it easier to differentiate between the metrics in your analysis tool.

#### StatsD Keys

There are plenty of keys (metrics) available when you enable the StatsD instrumentation, but these are the basics:

- API traffic handled by Gateway: `gauges.<prefix>.Load.rps` (requests per second)
- Tyk Gateway API: `counters.<prefix>.SystemAPICall.called.count` (calls count) and `timers.<prefix>.SystemAPICall.success` (response time)
- Tyk Dashboard API: `counters.<prefix>.SystemAPICall.SystemCallComplete.count` (requests count), `counters.<prefix>.DashSystemAPIError.*` (api error reporting)
- Tyk Pump records: `counters.<prefix>.record.count` (number of records processed by pump)


### NewRelic Instrumentation

Tyk Gateway has been instrumented for NewRelic metrics since v2.5. Simply add the following config section to `tyk.conf` to enable the instrumentation and generation of data:

```json
{
  "newrelic": {
    "app_name": "<app-name>",
    "license_key": "<license_key>"
  }
}
```


## Logging

Tyk Gateway emits different types of logs for various operational aspects. **System logs** capture internal gateway events and are output to stderr and stdout, typically used for monitoring and debugging. **API traffic logs**, also known as transaction analytics, record details of every request and response handled by the gateway and are stored in Redis before being processed by Tyk Pump for persistence. While system logs focus on the gateway's internal operations and errors, API traffic logs provide insights into API usage, security events, and performance trends. Logging verbosity and format can be customized to suit different operational needs.


## System Logs

Tyk will log **system events** to `stderr` and `stdout`.

In a typical installation, these will be handled or redirected by the service manager running the process, and depending on the Linux distribution, will either be output to `/var/log/` or `/var/log/upstart`.

Tyk will try to output structured logs, and so will include context data around request errors where possible.

If configured, then a [logging event handler]({{< ref "api-management/gateway-events#logging-api-events-1" >}}) will also report **API events** to the configured log output.

When contacting support, you may be asked to change the logging level as part of the support handling process. See [Support Information]({{< ref "api-management/troubleshooting-debugging#support-information" >}}) for more details.

### Configure Logging in Tyk

Log data is usually of the Error level and higher, though you can enable Debug mode reporting by adding the `--debug` flag to the process run command.

There are four levels of verbosity of logging that Tyk can generate:
- `debug` which generates a high volume of logs and is not recommended for live
- `info` is the default logging level
- `warn` will log only warnings and errrors
- `error` is the most minimal level of logging, reporting only errors

You can set the logging verbosity in two ways:
1. Via an Environment Variable to affect [all Tyk components]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#setting-log-verbosity-for-all-tyk-components" >}})
2. Just for the [Gateway]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#setting-log-verbosity-for-the-gateway-only" >}}) via your `tyk.conf` config file 

{{< warning success >}}
**Warning**  

Debug mode generates a lot of output and is not recommended except when debugging.
{{< /warning >}}

#### Setting log verbosity for all Tyk components

You can control the log verbosity across all installed Tyk components using the `TYK_LOGLEVEL` environment variable.

Tyk support can advise you which verbosity setting to use.

#### Setting log verbosity for the Gateway Only

Sometimes you will want to have more detailed logging for the Tyk Gateway than for the other components, so there is an individual control for you to set the logging level in your `tyk.conf`:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info"
}
```

If unset or left empty, it will default to `info`. 

#### Setting log format (only available for the Gateway)

As of Tyk Gateway `v5.6.0`, you can control log format using the `TYK_LOGFORMAT` environment variable. By default, logs are in `default` format, but setting `TYK_LOGFORMAT` to `json` will output logs in JSON format.

##### Default logging format
```
time="Sep 05 09:04:12" level=info msg="Tyk API Gateway v5.6.0" prefix=main
```

##### JSON logging format
```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Tyk API Gateway v5.6.0","prefix":"main","time":"2024-09-05T09:01:23-04:00"}
```
{{< note >}}
**Note**  
As a general performance tip, the `json` output format incurs less memory allocation overhead than the default logger. For optimal performance, it's recommended to configure logging in the JSON format.
{{< /note >}}

### Exporting Logs to Third-Party Tools

Tyk can be configured to send log data from multiple Tyk processes to a 3rd party server for aggregation and analysis.

The following servers are supported:
- [Sentry](#sentry)
- [Logstash](#logstash)
- [Graylog](#graylog)
- [Syslog](#syslog)

#### Sentry

To enable Sentry as a log aggregator, update these settings in both your `tyk.conf` and your `tyk_analytics.conf`:

*   `use_sentry`: Set this to `true` to enable the Sentry logger, you must specify a Sentry DSN under `sentry_code`.

*   `sentry_code`: The Sentry-assigned DSN (a kind of URL endpoint) that Tyk can send log data to.

#### Logstash

To enable Logstash as a log aggregator, update these settings in your `tyk.conf`:

*   `use_logstash`: Set this to `true` to enable the Logstash logger.

*   `logstash_transport`: The Logstash transport to use, should be `"tcp"`.

*   `logstash_network_addr`: Set to the Logstash client network address, should be in the form of `hostname:port`.

#### Graylog

To enable Graylog as a log aggregator, update these settings in your `tyk.conf`:

*   `use_graylog`: Set this to `true` to enable the Graylog logger.

*   `graylog_network_addr`: The Graylog client address in the form of `<graylog_ip>:<graylog_port>`.

#### Syslog

To enable Syslog as a log aggregator, update these settings in your `tyk.conf`:

*   `use_syslog`: Set this to `true` to enable the Syslog logger.

*   `syslog_transport`: The Syslog transport to use, should be `"udp"` or empty.

*   `syslog_network_addr`: Set to the Syslog client network address, should be in the form of `hostname:port`

## Logging API traffic

Tyk Gateway can be configured to generate a record of every request made to APIs deployed on the gateway and the response sent back to the originating client. The details of these transactions will be stored in the Redis storage, from which they can be transferred to persistent storage using [Tyk Pump]({{< ref "tyk-pump" >}}). In Tyk these transaction logs are also referred to as traffic analytics or simply analytics.

### When to Enable API Traffic Logging

1. **API usage trends**
    
    Monitoring the usage of your APIs is a key functionality provided by any API Management product. Traffic analytics give you visibility of specific and aggregated accesses to your services which you can monitor trends over time. You can identify popular and underused services which can assist with, for example, determining the demand profile for your services and thus appropriate sizing of the upstream capacity.


1. **Security monitoring**
    
    Tracking requests made to security-critical endpoints, like those used for authentication or authorization, can help in identifying and mitigating potential security threats. Monitoring these endpoints for unusual activity patterns is a proactive security measure.


1. **Development and testing**
    
    Enabling tracking during the development and testing phases can provide detailed insights into the API's behavior, facilitating bug identification and performance optimization. Adjustments to tracking settings can be made as the API transitions to production based on operational requirements.

### How API Traffic Logging Works
Traffic analytics logging is enabled in the Gateway configuration using the `enable_analytics` [option]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#enable_analytics">}}) (or using the equivalent environment variable `TYK_GW_ENABLEANALYTICS`).

The transaction records generated by the Gateway are stored in Redis, from which Tyk Pump can be configured to transfer them to the desired persistent storage. When using Tyk Dashboard, the [Aggregate Pump]({{< ref "api-management/tyk-pump#tyk-dashboard">}}) can be used to collate aggregated data that is presented in the [analytics]({{< ref "api-management/dashboard-configuration#traffic-analytics">}}) screens of the Tyk Dashboard.

The Gateway will not, by default, include the request and response payloads in the transaction records. This minimizes the size of the records and also avoids logging any sensitive content. The [detailed recording]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#enable-detailed-recording" >}}) option is provided if you need to capture the payloads in the records.

You can suppress the generation of transaction records for any endpoint by enabling the [do-not-track middleware]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#do-not-track-overview" >}}) for that endpoint. This provides granular control over request tracking.

You can find details of all the options available to you when configuring analytics in the Gateway in the [reference documentation]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#analytics_config">}}).



### Enable Detailed Recording

When [traffic analytics]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#logging-api-traffic" >}}) are enabled the Gateway will not, by default, include the request and response payloads in these transaction records. This minimizes the size of the records and also avoids logging any sensitive content.

You can, however, configure Tyk to capture the payloads in the transaction records if required. This can be particularly useful during development and testing phases or when debugging an issue with an API.

This is referred to as detailed recording and can be enabled at different levels of granularity. The order of precedence is:
1. [API level]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#configure-at-api-level" >}})
2. [Key level]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#configure-at-key-level" >}})
3. [Gateway level]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#configure-at-gateway-level" >}})

Consequently, Tyk will first check whether the API definition has detailed recording enabled to determine whether to log the request and response bodies. If it does not, then it will check the key being used in the request and finally it will check the Gateway configuration.

<br>

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Be aware that enabling detailed recording greatly increases the size of the records and will require significantly more storage space as Tyk will store the entire request and response in wire format.
<br>
<br>
Tyk Cloud users can enable detailed recording per-API following the instructions on this page or, if required at the Gateway level, via a support request. The traffic analytics are subject to the subscription's storage quota and so we recommend that detailed logging only be enabled if absolutely necessary to avoid unnecessary costs.
{{< /note >}}

#### Configure at API level

You can enable detailed recording at a granular level (only for specific APIs) using configuration within the API definition.

##### Tyk OAS APIs

When working with Tyk OAS APIs, you should configure `detailedActivityLogs: "true"` in the `x-tyk-api-gateway.server` object, for example:

```json {hl_lines=["31-33"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-detailed-recording",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/xml": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "xmlget",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-detailed-recording",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "detailedActivityLogs": {
                "enabled": true
            },
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-detailed-recording/",
                "strip": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition that you can import into Tyk to try out detailed recording. It will generate detailed transaction records for all calls made to the `/example-detailed-recording` API.

In the Dashboard UI, you can configure detailed recording using the Enable Detailed Activity Logs option in the API Designer.

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-detailed-logs.png" alt="Enabling detailed activity logs for a Tyk OAS API" >}}

##### Tyk Classic APIs {#tyk-classic}

When working with Tyk Classic APIs, you should configure `enable_detailed_recording: "true"` in the root of the API definition:

```
"enable_detailed_recording": true
```

In the Dashboard UI, you can configure detailed recording using the Enable Detailed Logging option in Core Settings.

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/endpoint-designer/classic-detailed-logging.png" alt="Enabling detailed activity logs for a Tyk Classic API" >}}

##### Tyk Operator

The process for configuring detailed recording using Tyk Operator is similar to that explained in [Detailed recording with Tyk Classic APIs](#tyk-classic).

The example API Definition below enabled detailed recording by setting `spec.enable_detailed_recording` to `true`.

```yaml {linenos=true, linenostart=1, hl_lines=["10-10"]}
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  name: httpbin
  use_keyless: true
  protocol: http
  active: true
  enable_detailed_recording: true
  proxy:
    target_url: http://httpbin.org
    listen_path: /httpbin
    strip_listen_path: true
```

#### Configure at Key Level
An alternative approach to controlling detailed recording is to enable it only for specific [access keys]({{< ref "api-management/policies#what-is-a-session-object" >}}). This is particularly useful for debugging purposes where you can configure detailed recording only for the key(s) that are reporting issues.

You can enable detailed recording for a key simply by adding the following to the root of the key's JSON file:

```
"enable_detailed_recording": true
```
{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

This will enable detailed recording only for API transactions where the key is used in the request.
{{< /note >}}

#### Configure at Gateway Level
Detailed recording can be configured at the system level, affecting all APIs deployed on the Gateway, by enabling the [detailed recording]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#analytics_configenable_detailed_recording" >}}) option in `tyk.conf`.

```.json
{
    "enable_analytics" : true,
    "analytics_config": {
        "enable_detailed_recording": true
    }
}
```


### Do Not Track

When transaction logging is enabled in the Tyk Gateway, a transaction record will be generated for every request made to an API endpoint deployed on the gateway. You can suppress the generation of transaction records for any API by enabling the do-not-track middleware. This provides granular control over request tracking.

Refer this [docs]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#do-not-track-overview" >}}) for more information.

## OpenTelemetry

Starting from Tyk Gateway version 5.2, you can leverage the power of OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework designed for cloud-native software. This enhances your API monitoring with end-to-end distributed tracing.

This documentation will guide you through the process of enabling and configuring OpenTelemetry in Tyk Gateway. You'll also learn how to customize trace detail levels to meet your monitoring requirements.

For further guidance on configuring your observability back-end, explore our guides for [Datadog]({{< ref "#datadog" >}}), [Dynatrace]({{< ref "#dynatrace" >}}), [Jaeger]({{< ref "#jaeger" >}}) and [New Relic]({{< ref "#new-relic" >}}).

### Enabling OpenTelemetry

1. **Enable at Gateway Level**

    Begin by enabling OpenTelemetry in the Tyk Gateway. You can achieve this by editing the Tyk Gateway configuration file or by setting the corresponding environment variable (`TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED`).

    Example Configuration:

    ```json
    {
    "opentelemetry": {
        "enabled": true
    }
    }
    ```

    By default, OpenTelemetry spans are exported using the `gRPC` protocol to `localhost:4317`. For more configuration options and default values, refer to the [OpenTelemetry configuration details]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#opentelemetry" >}}). 

<a id="enable-detailed-tracing-at-api-level-optional"></a>

2. **Enable Detailed Tracing at API Level (Optional)**

    After enabling OpenTelemetry at the gateway level, you have the option to activate detailed tracing for specific APIs. Edit the respective API definition and set the `detailed_tracing` option to either `true` or `false`. By default, this setting is `false`.

{{< note info >}}
**Note**

From version 5.3, you can enable or disable this Detailed Tracing option in Tyk OAS APIs through the Dashboard's UI. Navigate to your API's settings and toggle the *"Enable Detailed Tracing"* option.

{{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/detailed-tracing-oas.png" alt="Detailed Tracing Disabled" width="800px" >}}
{{< /note >}}

#### Which Spans Will Be Exported?

- When set to `false`:
  Detailed tracing set to `false` generates two spans encapsulating the entire request lifecycle. These spans include attributes and tags but lack fine-grained details. The parent span represents the total time from request reception to response and the child span represent the time spent in the upstream service.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/detailed-tracing-false.png" alt="Detailed Tracing Disabled" width="800px" >}}

- When set to true:
  Detailed tracing set to `true` creates a span for each middleware involved in request processing. These spans offer detailed insights, including the time taken for each middleware execution and the sequence of invocations.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/detailed-tracing-true.png" alt="Detailed Tracing Enabled" width="800px" >}}

By choosing the appropriate setting, you can customize the level of tracing detail to suit your monitoring needs.

### Understanding Your Traces

Tyk Gateway exposes a helpful set of *span attributes* and *resource attributes* with the generated spans. These attributes provide useful insights for analyzing your API requests. A clear analysis can be obtained by observing the specific actions and associated context within each request/response. This is where span and resource attributes play a significant role.

#### Span Attributes

A span is a named, timed operation that represents an operation. Multiple spans represent different parts of the workflow and are pieced together to create a trace. While each span includes a duration indicating how long the operation took, the span attributes provide additional contextual metadata.

Span attributes are key-value pairs that provide contextual metadata for individual spans. Tyk automatically sets the following span attributes:

- `tyk.api.name`: API name.
- `tyk.api.orgid`: Organization ID.
- `tyk.api.id`: API ID.
- `tyk.api.path`: API listen path.
- `tyk.api.tags`: If tagging is enabled in the API definition, the tags are added here.

#### Resource Attributes

Resource attributes provide contextual information about the entity that produced the telemetry data. Tyk exposes following resource attributes:

#### Service Attributes

The service attributes supported by Tyk are:

| Attribute             | Type   | Description |

By understanding and using these resource attributes, you can gain better insights into the performance of your API Gateways.

#### Common HTTP Span Attributes

Tyk follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for HTTP spans. You can find detailed information on common attributes [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md#common-attributes).

Some of these common attributes include:

- `http.method`: HTTP request method.
- `http.scheme`: URL scheme.
- `http.status_code`: HTTP response status code.
- `http.url`: Full HTTP request URL.

For the full list and details, refer to the official [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md#common-attributes).

### Advanced OpenTelemetry Capabilities

#### Context Propagation

This setting allows you to specify the type of context propagator to use for trace data. It's essential for ensuring compatibility and data integrity between different services in your architecture. The available options are:

- **tracecontext**: This option supports the [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) format.
- **b3**: This option serializes `SpanContext` to/from the B3 multi Headers format. [Here](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation) you can find more information of this propagator.

The default setting is `tracecontext`. To configure this setting, you have two options:

- **Environment Variable**: Use `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_CONTEXTPROPAGATION` to specify the context propagator type.
- **Configuration File**: Navigate to the `opentelemetry.context_propagation` field in your configuration file to set your preferred option.

#### Sampling Strategies

Tyk supports configuring the following sampling strategies via the Sampling configuration structure:

##### Sampling Type

This setting dictates the sampling policy that OpenTelemetry uses to decide if a trace should be sampled for analysis. The decision is made at the start of a trace and applies throughout its lifetime. By default, the setting is `AlwaysOn`.

To customize, you can either set the `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_SAMPLING_TYPE` environment variable or modify the `opentelemetry.sampling.type` field in the Tyk Gateway configuration file. Valid values for this setting are:

- **AlwaysOn**: All traces are sampled.
- **AlwaysOff**: No traces are sampled.
- **TraceIDRatioBased**: Samples traces based on a specified ratio.

##### Sampling Rate

This field is crucial when the `Type` is configured to `TraceIDRatioBased`. It defines the fraction of traces that OpenTelemetry will aim to sample, and accepts a value between 0.0 and 1.0. For example, a `Rate` set to 0.5 implies that approximately 50% of the traces will be sampled. The default value is 0.5. To configure this setting, you have the following options:

- **Environment Variable**: Use `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_SAMPLING_RATE`.
- **Configuration File**: Update the `opentelemetry.sampling.rate` field in the configuration file.

##### ParentBased Sampling

This option is useful for ensuring the sampling consistency between parent and child spans. Specifically, if a parent span is sampled, all it's child spans will be sampled as well. This setting is particularly effective when used with `TraceIDRatioBased`, as it helps to keep the entire transaction story together. Using `ParentBased` with `AlwaysOn` or `AlwaysOff` may not be as useful, since in these cases, either all or no spans are sampled. The default value is `false`. Configuration options include:

- **Environment Variable**: Use `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_SAMPLING_PARENTBASED`.
- **Configuration File**: Update the `opentelemetry.sampling.parent_based` field in the configuration file.

### Configuring Connection to OpenTelemetry Backend

Choose between HTTP and gRPC for the backend connection by configuring the `exporter` field to "http" or "grpc".

### Further Configuration Details

For more in-depth information on the configuration options available, please refer to our [OpenTelemetry Configuration Details Page]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#opentelemetry" >}}).

## OpenTelemetry Backends for Tracing

### Datadog

This guide explains how to configure Tyk API Gateway and the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect distributed traces in Datadog. It follows the reference documentation from [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otel_collector_datadog_exporter/?tab=onahost).

While this tutorial demonstrates using an OpenTelemetry Collector running in Docker, the core concepts remain consistent regardless of how and where the OpenTelemetry collector is deployed.

Whether you're using Tyk API Gateway in an open-source (OSS) or commercial deployment, the configuration options remain identical.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Tyk Gateway v5.2.0 or higher
- OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib). Make sure to use the Contrib distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector as it is required for the [Datadog exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/datadogexporter). 

#### Steps for Configuration

1. **Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector**

    You will need:
    - An [API key from Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#add-an-api-key-or-client-token). For example, `6c35dacbf2e16aa8cda85a58d9015c3c`. 
    - Your [Datadog site](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site). Examples are: `datadoghq.com`, `us3.datadoghq.com` and `datadoghq.eu`. 

    Create a new YAML configuration file named `otel-collector.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    receivers:
    otlp:
        protocols:
        grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
    processors:
    batch:
        send_batch_max_size: 100
        send_batch_size: 10
        timeout: 10s
    exporters:
    datadog:
        api:
        site: "YOUR-DATADOG-SITE"
        key: "YOUR-DATAGOG-API-KEY"
    service:
    pipelines:
        traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [datadog]

    ```

2. **Configure a test API**

    If you don't have any APIs configured yet, create a subdirectory called `apps` in the current directory. Create a new file `apidef-hello-world.json` and copy this very simple API definition for testing purposes:

    ```json
    { 
        "name": "Hello-World",
        "slug": "hello-world",
        "api_id": "Hello-World",
        "org_id": "1",
        "use_keyless": true,
        "detailed_tracing": true,
        "version_data": {
        "not_versioned": true,
        "versions": {
            "Default": {
            "name": "Default",
            "use_extended_paths": true
            }
        }
        },
        "proxy": {
        "listen_path": "/hello-world/",
        "target_url": "http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/",
        "strip_listen_path": true
        },
        "active": true
    }
    ```

3. **Create the Docker-Compose file**

    Save the following YAML configuration to a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

    ```yaml
    version: "2"
    services:
    # OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib
    otel-collector:
        image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
        volumes:
        - ./otel-collector.yml:/etc/otel-collector.yml
        command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector.yml"]
        ports:
        - "4317" # OTLP gRPC receiver
        networks:
        - tyk
    
    # Tyk API Gateway, open-source deployment
    tyk:
        image: tykio/tyk-gateway:v5.2
        ports:
        - 8080:8080
        environment:
        - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
        - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER=grpc
        - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317
        volumes:
        - ./apps:/opt/tyk-gateway/apps
        depends_on:
        - redis
        networks:
        - tyk

    redis:
        image: redis:4.0-alpine
        ports:
        - 6379:6379
        command: redis-server --appendonly yes
        networks:
        - tyk

    networks:
    tyk:
    ```


    To start the services, go to the directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

4. **Explore OpenTelemetry traces in Datadog**

    Begin by sending a few requests to the API endpoint configured in step 2: 
    ``
    http://localhost:8080/hello-world/
    ``

    Next, log in to Datadog and navigate to the 'APM' / 'Traces' section. Here, you should start observing traces generated by Tyk:

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-trace-tyk-datadog.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway distributed trace in Datadog" >}}

    Click on a trace to view all its internal spans:

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-trace-tyk-datadog-spans.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway spans in Datadog" >}}

    Datadog will generate a service entry to monitor Tyk API Gateway and will automatically compute valuable metrics using the ingested traces.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-tyk-service-monitoring-datadog.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway service monitoring in Datadog" >}}

#### Troubleshooting

If you do not observe any traces appearing in Datadog, consider the following steps for resolution:

- Logging: Examine logs from Tyk API Gateway and from the OpenTelemetry Collector for any issues or warnings that might provide insights.
- Data Ingestion Delays: Be patient, as there could be some delay in data ingestion. Wait for 10 seconds to see if traces eventually appear, as this is the timeout we have configured in the batch processing of the OpenTelemetry collector within step 1.

### Dynatrace

This documentation covers how to set up Dynatrace to ingest OpenTelemetry traces via the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTel Collector) using Docker.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Dynatrace account](https://www.dynatrace.com/)
- Dynatrace Token
- Gateway v5.2.0 or higher
- OTel Collector [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector)

#### Steps for Configuration

1. **Generate Dynatrace Token**

    1. In the Dynatrace console, navigate to access keys.
    2. Click on _Create a new key_
    3. You will be prompted to select a scope. Choose _Ingest OpenTelemetry_ traces.
    4. Save the generated token securely; it cannot be retrieved once lost.

    Example of a generated token ([taken from Dynatrace website](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication#token-format-example)):

    ```bash
    dt0s01.ST2EY72KQINMH574WMNVI7YN.G3DFPBEJYMODIDAEX454M7YWBUVEFOWKPRVMWFASS64NFH52PX6BNDVFFM572RZM
    ```

2. **Configuration Files**

    1. **OTel Collector Configuration File**

    Create a YAML file named `otel-collector-config.yml`. In this file replace `<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-STRING>` with the string from the address bar when you log into Dynatrace. Replace `<YOUR-DYNATRACE-API-KEY>` with the token you generated earlier.

    Here's a sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    receivers:
    otlp:
        protocols:
        http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
        grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
    processors:
    batch:
    exporters:
    otlphttp:
        endpoint: "https://<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-STRING>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp"
        headers:
        Authorization: "Api-Token <YOUR-DYNATRACE-API-KEY>" # You must keep 'Api-Token', just modify <YOUR-DYNATRACE-API-KEY>
    extensions:
    health_check:
    pprof:
        endpoint: :1888
    zpages:
        endpoint: :55679
    service:
    extensions: [pprof, zpages, health_check]
    pipelines:
        traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlphttp]
    ```

    2. **Docker Compose File**

    Create a file named docker-compose.yml.

    Here is the sample Docker Compose file:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
    otel-collector:
        image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest
        volumes:
        - ./configs/otel-collector-config.yml:/etc/otel-collector.yml
        command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector.yml"]
        networks:
        - tyk
        ports:
        - "1888:1888" # pprof extension
        - "13133:13133" # health_check extension
        - "4317:4317" # OTLP gRPC receiver
        - "4318:4318" # OTLP http receiver
        - "55670:55679" # zpages extension
    networks:
    tyk:
    ```

3. **Testing and Viewing Traces**

    **1.** Launch the Docker containers: docker-compose up -d

    **2.** Initialize your Tyk environment.

    **3.** Configure a basic HTTP API on the Tyk Gateway or Dashboard.

    **4.** Use cURL or Postman to send requests to the API gateway.

    **5.** Navigate to Dynatrace -> Services -> Tyk-Gateway.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/dynatrace-services.png" alt="Dynatrace Services" >}}

    **6.** Wait for 5 minutes and refresh.

    **7.** Traces, along with graphs, should appear. If they don't, click on the "Full Search" button.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/dynatrace-metrics.png" alt="Dynatrace Metrics" >}}

4. **Troubleshooting**

    - If traces are not appearing, try clicking on the "Full Search" button after waiting for 5 minutes.
    Make sure your Dynatrace token is correct in the configuration files.
    - Validate the Docker Compose setup by checking the logs for any errors: `docker-compose logs`

And there you have it! You've successfully integrated Dynatrace with the OpenTelemetry Collector using Docker.

### Elasticsearch

This quick start explains how to configure Tyk API Gateway (OSS, self-managed or hybrid gateway connected to Tyk Cloud) with the OpenTelemetry Collector to export distributed traces to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/observability).

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

* Tyk Gateway v5.2 or higher
* OpenTelemetry Collector deployed locally
* Elasticsearch deployed locally or an account on Elastic Cloud with Elastic APM

Elastic Observability natively supports OpenTelemetry and its OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to ingest traces, metrics, and logs. 

{{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-otel.png" alt="OpenTelemetry support in Elasticsearch" >}}
Credit: Elasticsearch, [OpenTelemetry on Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/blog/opentelemetry-observability)

#### Steps for Configuration 

1. **Configure Tyk API Gateway**

    To enable OpenTelemetry in Tyk API Gateway, follow these steps:

    For Tyk Helm Charts:
    * Add the following configuration to the Tyk Gateway section:

    ```yaml
    tyk-gateway:
    gateway:
        opentelemetry:
        enabled: true
        endpoint: {{Add your endpoint here}}
        exporter: grpc
    ```

    For Docker Compose:
    * In your docker-compose.yml file for Tyk Gateway, add the following environment variables:

    ```yaml
    environment:
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER=grpc
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT={{Add your endpoint here}}
    ```

    Make sure to replace {{Add your endpoint here}} with the appropriate endpoint from your OpenTelemetry collector.

    After enabling OpenTelemetry at the Gateway level, you can activate [detailed tracing]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#opentelemetry" >}}) for specific APIs by editing their respective API definitions. Set the `detailed_tracing` option to either true or false. By default, this setting is false.

2. **Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to Export to Elasticsearch**

    To configure the OTel Collector with Elasticsearch Cloud, follow these steps:

    * Sign up for an [Elastic account](https://www.elastic.co/) if you haven't already
    * Once logged in to your Elastic account, select "Observability" and click on the option "Monitor my application performance"

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-01.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" >}}

    * Scroll down to the APM Agents section and click on the OpenTelemetry tab

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-02.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" >}}

    * Search for the section "Configure OpenTelemetry in your application". You will need to copy the value of "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT" and "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS" in your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-03.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" >}}

    * Update your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration, here's a simple example:

    ```yaml
    receivers:
    otlp:
        protocols:
        grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 # OpenTelemetry receiver endpoint
    processors:
    batch:
    exporters:
    otlp/elastic:
        endpoint: "ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_ENDPOINT_GOES_HERE" #exclude scheme, e.g. HTTPS:// or HTTP://
        headers:
        # Elastic APM Server secret token
        Authorization: "Bearer ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
    service:
    pipelines:
        traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        exporters: [otlp/elastic]
    ```

    If are running Elasticsearch locally, you will need to use your APM Server endpoint (elastic-apm-server:8200) and set-up [a secret token authorization in ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/secret-token.html).

    You can refer to the [example configuration provided by Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/open-telemetry-direct.html#connect-open-telemetry-collector) for more guidance on the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.

3. **Explore OpenTelemetry Traces in Elasticsearch**

    * In Elasticsearch Cloud:
    * Go to "Home" and select "Observability."
    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-04.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" >}}
    * On the right menu, click on "APM / Services."
    * Click on "tyk-gateway."

    You will see a dashboard automatically generated based on the distributed traces sent by Tyk API Gateway to Elasticsearch.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-05.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" >}}

    Select a transaction to view more details, including the distributed traces:

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-06.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" >}}

### New Relic

This guide provides a step-by-step procedure to integrate New Relic with Tyk Gateway via the OpenTelemetry Collector. At the end of this guide, you will be able to visualize traces and metrics from your Tyk Gateway on the New Relic console.

#### Prerequisites

    93qwr27e49e168d3844c5h3d1e878a463f24NZJL
    ```

2. **Configuration Files**

    **OTel Collector Configuration YAML**

    1. Create a file named `otel-collector-config.yml` under the configs directory.
    2. Copy the following template into that file:

    ```yaml
    receivers:
    otlp:
        protocols:
        http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
        grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
    processors:
    batch:
    exporters:
    otlphttp:
        endpoint: "<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-STRING>"
        headers:
        api-Key: "<YOUR-NEW-RELIC-API-KEY>"
    extensions:
    health_check:
    pprof:
        endpoint: :1888
    zpages:
        endpoint: :55679
    service:
    extensions: [pprof, zpages, health_check]
    pipelines:
        traces:
        receivers: [otlp]

        exporters: [otlphttp]
    ```

    - Replace `<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-STRING>` with your specific New Relic endpoint (`https://otlp.nr-data.net` for US or `https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net` for EU).
    - Replace `<YOUR-NEW-RELIC-API-KEY>` with the API key obtained in Step 1.

    **Docker Compose configuration**

    1. Create a file named docker-compose.yml at the root level of your project directory.

    2. Paste the following code into that file:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
    otel-collector:
        image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest
        volumes:
        - ./otel-collector-config.yml:/etc/otel-collector.yml
        command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector.yml"]
        networks:
        - tyk
        ports:
        - "1888:1888" # pprof extension
        - "13133:13133" # health_check extension
        - "4317:4317" # OTLP gRPC receiver
        - "4318:4318" # OTLP http receiver
        - "55670:55679" # zpages extension

    networks:
    tyk:
    ```
    <br>

    {{< note success >}}
**Note**

Replace the variable fields with the relevant data.
    {{< /note >}}

3. **Testing and Verifying Traces**

    1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services.

    2. Initialize your Tyk environment.

    3. Create a simple `httpbin` API using Tyk Dashboard. You can follow the [Tyk Dashboard documentation]({{< ref "api-management/gateway-config-managing-classic#create-an-api" >}}) for more information.

    4. Send requests to the API using cURL or Postman.

    5. Open New Relic Console.

    6. Navigate to `APM & Services → Services - OpenTelemetry → tyk-gateway`.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/new-relic-services.png" alt="New Relic Services" >}}

    7. Wait for about 5 minutes for the data to populate.

    Traces and graphs should now be visible on your New Relic console.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/new-relic-metrics.png" alt="New Relic Metrics" >}}

**Note**

If traces are not showing, try refreshing the New Relic dashboard.
    {{< /note >}}

#### Troubleshooting

- If the traces aren't appearing, double-check your API key and endpoints.
- Ensure that your Tyk Gateway and New Relic are both running and connected.

#### Conclusion

You have successfully integrated New Relic with Tyk Gateway via the OpenTelemetry Collector. You can now monitor and trace your APIs directly from the New Relic console.
### Jaeger

#### Using Docker

This quick start guide offers a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for configuring Tyk API Gateway (OSS, self-managed or hybrid gateway connected to Tyk Cloud) with OpenTelemetry and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) to significantly improve API observability. We will cover the installation of essential components, their configuration, and the process of ensuring seamless integration.

For Kubernetes instructions, please refer to [How to integrate with Jaeger on Kubernetes]({{< ref "#using-kubernetes" >}}).

##### Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

- [Docker installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Gateway v5.2.0 or higher

##### Steps for Configuration

1. **Create the Docker-Compose File for Jaeger**

    Save the following YAML configuration in a file named docker-compose.yml:

    ```yaml
    version: "2"
    services:
    # Jaeger: Distributed Tracing System
    jaeger-all-in-one:
        image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
        ports:
        - "16686:16686" # Jaeger UI
        - "4317:4317" # OTLP receiver
    ```

    This configuration sets up Jaeger's all-in-one instance with ports exposed for Jaeger UI and the OTLP receiver.

2. **Deploy a Test API Definition**

    If you haven't configured any APIs yet, follow these steps:

    - Create a subdirectory named apps in the current directory.
    - Create a new file named `apidef-hello-world.json`.
    - Copy the provided simple API definition below into the `apidef-hello-world.json` file:


    ```json
    { 
        "name": "Hello-World",
        "slug": "hello-world",
        "api_id": "Hello-World",
        "org_id": "1",
        "use_keyless": true,
        "detailed_tracing": true,
        "version_data": {
        "not_versioned": true,
        "versions": {
            "Default": {
            "name": "Default",
            "use_extended_paths": true
            }
        }
        },
        "proxy": {
        "listen_path": "/hello-world/",
        "target_url": "http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/",
        "strip_listen_path": true
        },
        "active": true
    }
    ```

    This API definition sets up a basic API named Hello-World for testing purposes, configured to proxy requests to `http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/`.

3. **Run Tyk Gateway OSS with OpenTelemetry Enabled**

    To run Tyk Gateway with OpenTelemetry integration, extend the previous Docker Compose file to include Tyk Gateway and Redis services. Follow these steps:

    - Add the following configuration to your existing docker-compose.yml file:

    ```yaml
    # ... Existing docker-compose.yml content for jaeger

    tyk:
    image: tykio/tyk-gateway:v5.2.0
    ports:
        - 8080:8080
    environment:
        - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
        - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER=grpc
        - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=jaeger-all-in-one:4317
    volumes:
        - ${TYK_APPS:-./apps}:/opt/tyk-gateway/apps
    depends_on:
        - redis

    redis:
    image: redis:4.0-alpine
    ports:
        - 6379:6379
    command: redis-server --appendonly yes
    ```

    - Navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file in your terminal.
    - Execute the following command to start the services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

4. **Explore OpenTelemetry Traces in Jaeger**

    - Start by sending a few requests to the API endpoint configured in Step 2:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/hello-world/ -i
    ```

    - Access Jaeger at *http://localhost:16686*.
    - In Jaeger's interface:
    - Select the service named tyk-gateway.
    - Click the *Find Traces* button.

    You should observe traces generated by Tyk Gateway, showcasing the distributed tracing information.

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-trace-tyk-jaeger.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway distributed trace in Jaeger" >}}

    Select a trace to visualize its corresponding internal spans:

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-trace-tyk-jaeger-spans.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway spans in Jaeger" >}}


#### Using Kubernetes

This quick start guide offers a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for configuring Tyk Gateway OSS with OpenTelemetry and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) on Kubernetes to significantly improve API observability. We will cover the installation of essential components, their configuration, and the process of ensuring seamless integration.

For Docker instructions, please refer to [How to integrate with Jaeger on Docker]({{< ref "#using-docker" >}}).


##### Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are in place before proceeding:

- A functional Kubernetes cluster
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) CLI tools installed

##### Steps for Configuration

1. **Install Jaeger Operator**

    For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use jaeger-all-in-one, which includes the Jaeger agent, collector, query, and UI in a single pod with in-memory storage. This deployment is intended for development, testing, and demo purposes. Other deployment patterns can be found in the [Jaeger Operator documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.51/operator/#deployment-strategies).


    1. Install the cert-manager release manifest (required by Jaeger)

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.2/cert-manager.yaml
    ```

    2. Install [Jaeger Operator](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/operator/)).

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace observability
    kubectl create -f https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/releases/download/v1.51.0/jaeger-operator.yaml -n observability

    ```

    3. After the Jaeger Operator is deployed to the `observability` namespace, create a Jaeger instance:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -n observability -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
    kind: Jaeger
    metadata:
    name: jaeger-all-in-one
    EOF
    ```

2. **Deploy Tyk Gateway with OpenTelemetry Enabled using Helm**

    To install or upgrade [Tyk Gateway OSS using Helm](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-charts/tree/main/tyk-oss), execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    NAMESPACE=tyk
    APISecret=foo
    TykVersion=v5.3.0
    REDIS_BITNAMI_CHART_VERSION=19.0.2

    helm upgrade tyk-redis oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/redis -n $NAMESPACE --create-namespace --install --version $REDIS_BITNAMI_CHART_VERSION
    helm upgrade tyk-otel tyk-helm/tyk-oss -n $NAMESPACE --create-namespace \
    --install \
    --set global.secrets.APISecret="$APISecret" \
    --set tyk-gateway.gateway.image.tag=$TykVersion \
    --set global.redis.addrs="{tyk-redis-master.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local:6379}" \
    --set global.redis.pass="$(kubectl get secret --namespace $NAMESPACE tyk-redis -o jsonpath='{.data.redis-password}' | base64 -d)" \
    --set tyk-gateway.gateway.opentelemetry.enabled=true \
    --set tyk-gateway.gateway.opentelemetry.exporter="grpc" \
    --set tyk-gateway.gateway.opentelemetry.endpoint="jaeger-all-in-one-collector.observability.svc:4317"
    ```

    <br>

    {{< note success >}}
**Note**

Please make sure you are installing Redis versions that are supported by Tyk. Please refer to Tyk docs to get list of [supported versions]({{< ref "tyk-self-managed#redis-1" >}}).
    {{< /note >}}


    Tyk Gateway is now accessible through service gateway-svc-tyk-oss-tyk-gateway at port 8080 and exports the OpenTelemetry traces to the `jaeger-all-in-one-collector` service.

3. **Deploy Tyk Operator**

    Deploy Tyk Operator to manage APIs in your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace tyk-operator-system
    kubectl create secret -n tyk-operator-system generic tyk-operator-conf \
    --from-literal "TYK_AUTH=$APISecret" \
    --from-literal "TYK_ORG=org" \
    --from-literal "TYK_MODE=ce" \
    --from-literal "TYK_URL=http://gateway-svc-tyk-otel-tyk-gateway.tyk.svc:8080" \
    --from-literal "TYK_TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true"
    helm install tyk-operator tyk-helm/tyk-operator -n tyk-operator-system

    ```

4. **Deploy a Test API Definition**

    Save the following API definition as `apidef-hello-world.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ApiDefinition
    metadata:
    name: hello-world
    spec:
    name: hello-world
    use_keyless: true
    protocol: http
    active: true
    proxy:
    target_url: http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/
    listen_path: /hello-world
    strip_listen_path: true
    ```

    To apply this API definition, run the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f apidef-hello-world.yaml 
    ```

    This step deploys an API definition named hello-world using the provided configuration. It enables a keyless HTTP API proxying requests to http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/ and accessible via the path /hello-world.

5. **Explore OpenTelemetry traces in Jaeger**

    You can use the kubectl `port-forward command` to access Tyk and Jaeger services running in the cluster from your local machine's localhost:

    For Tyk API Gateway:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/gateway-svc-tyk-otel-tyk-gateway 8080:8080 -n tyk
    ```

    For Jaeger:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/jaeger-all-in-one-query 16686 -n observability
    ```

    Begin by sending a few requests to the API endpoint configured in step 2: 

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/hello-world/ -i
    ```

    Next, navigate to Jaeger on `http://localhost:16686`, select the ´service´ called ´tyk-gateway´ and click on the button ´Find traces´. You should see traces generated by Tyk:

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-trace-tyk-jaeger.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway distributed trace in Jaeger" >}}

    Click on a trace to view all its internal spans:

    {{< img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/api-gateway-trace-tyk-jaeger-spans.png" alt="Tyk API Gateway spans in Jaeger" >}}

## OpenTracing (deprecated)

{{< warning success >}}
**Deprecation**

OpenTracing is now deprecated. We have introduced support of [OpenTelemetry]({{<ref "api-management/logs-metrics#opentelemetry">}}) in v5.2. We recommend users to migrate to OpenTelemetry for better supports of your tracing needs.
{{< /warning >}}

### Supported observability tools
- [Jaeger]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#jaeger-1" >}})
- [Zipkin]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#zipkin" >}})
- [New Relic]({{< ref "api-management/logs-metrics#new-relic-1" >}})

### Enabling OpenTracing
To enable OpenTracing, add the following tracing configuration to your Gateway `tyk.conf` file.

```.json
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "${tracer_name}",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

- `name` is the name of the supported tracer
- `enabled`: set this to true to enable tracing
- `options`: key/value pairs for configuring the enabled tracer. See the
 supported tracer documentation for more details.

Tyk will automatically propagate tracing headers to APIs  when tracing is enabled.

### Jaeger

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  
[Tyk Gateway 5.2]({{< ref "developer-support/release-notes/gateway.md" >}}) now includes OpenTelemetry Tracing. We recommend migrating to OpenTelemetry for better trace insights and more comprehensive support. This change will offer you significant advantages in managing your distributed tracing needs.

Subsequently, we recommend following this guide [Exporting OpenTelemetry Distributed Traces to Jaeger]({{< ref "#using-docker" >}}). 
{{< /note >}}

Tyk uses [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) with the [Jaeger client libraries](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.11/client-libraries/) to send Tyk Gateway traces to Jaeger.

**Configuring Jaeger**

In `tyk.conf` on `tracing` setting

```{.json}
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "jaeger",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

`options` are settings that are used to initialise the Jaeger client. For more details about the options [see client libraries](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.11/client-libraries/)

**Sample configuration**

```{.json}
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "jaeger",
    "options": {
      "baggage_restrictions": null,
      "disabled": false,
      "headers": null,
      "reporter": {
        "BufferFlushInterval": "0s",
        "collectorEndpoint": "",
        "localAgentHostPort": "jaeger:6831",
        "logSpans": true,
        "password": "",
        "queueSize": 0,
        "user": ""
      },
      "rpc_metrics": false,
      "sampler": {
        "maxOperations": 0,
        "param": 1,
        "samplingRefreshInterval": "0s",
        "samplingServerURL": "",
        "type": "const"
      },
      "serviceName": "tyk-gateway",
      "tags": null,
      "throttler": null
    }
  }
}
```

### New Relic

Tyk uses [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) to send Tyk Gateway traces to [*New Relic*](https://newrelic.com/) using the *Zipkin* format. <br>
Support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is on the near-term roadmap for us. More information can be found on [this community post](https://community.tyk.io/t/faq-opentelemetry-distributed-tracing/5682).

{{< /note >}}

**Configuring New Relic**

In `tyk.conf` under the `tracing` section

```.json
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "zipkin",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

In the `options` setting you can set the initialisation of the *Zipkin* client.

**Sample configuration**

```.json
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "zipkin",
    "options": {
      "reporter": {
        "url": "https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`reporter.url` is the URL to the *New Relic* server, where trace data will be sent to.

### Zipkin

Tyk uses [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) with the [Zipkin Go tracer](https://zipkin.io/pages/tracers_instrumentation) to send Tyk Gateway traces to Zipkin. Support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is on the near-term roadmap for us. More information can be found on [this community post](https://community.tyk.io/t/faq-opentelemetry-distributed-tracing/5682).

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

The CNCF (Cloud Native Foundation) has archived the OpenTracing project. This means that no new pull requests or feature requests are accepted into OpenTracing repositories.

While support for OpenTelemetry is on our near-term roadmap, you can continue to leverage OpenTracing to get timing and data from Tyk in your traces.
{{< /note >}}


**Configuring Zipkin**

In `tyk.conf` on `tracing` setting

```{.json}
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "zipkin",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

`options` are settings that are used to initialise the Zipkin client.

**Sample configuration**

```{.json}
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "zipkin",
    "options": {
      "reporter": {
        "url": "http:localhost:9411/api/v2/spans"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`reporter.url` is the URL to the Zipkin server, where trace data will be sent.
