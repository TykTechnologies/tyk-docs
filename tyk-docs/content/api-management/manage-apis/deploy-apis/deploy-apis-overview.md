This page explains the different methods available for creating and managing APIs in Tyk, each suited to different use cases and workflow requirements.

## File-based configuration {#file-based-configuration}

Load API configurations directly to the `/apps` folder using JSON API specifications. This method is available for open source users and is ideal for testing gateway and API configurations.

**Use case:** Testing and experimentation in development environments.

## Dashboard UI

Create and configure APIs through the web-based Dashboard interface. Changes take effect immediately, making this method suitable for learning, testing, and proof-of-concept work.

**Use case:** Manual API management, learning, and proof-of-concept projects.

* [Create an API with the Dashboard]({{< ref "api-management/gateway-config-managing-classic#create-an-api-with-the-dashboard" >}})

## Dashboard API and Gateway API

Programmatically create and manage APIs, policies, keys, and developer portals using REST APIs. This method provides flexibility for automation but requires imperative scripting.

**Use case:** Programmatic API management and basic automation needs.

- [Gateway API]({{< ref "tyk-gateway-api" >}})

## Tyk Sync

Manage API configurations declaratively using version-controlled files. Tyk Sync enables GitOps workflows by maintaining API configurations as code that can be versioned and deployed through CI/CD pipelines.

**Use case:** GitOps workflows and teams requiring version-controlled API configurations.

## Tyk Operator

Kubernetes-native API management using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Tyk Operator provides declarative configuration with automatic drift detection and reconciliation in Kubernetes environments.

**Use case:** Kubernetes-native environments requiring automated API lifecycle management.
