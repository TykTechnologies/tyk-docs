## SSE Proxy

[Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a subscribed client to receive automatic updates from a server via a long running HTTP connection. 
Unlike WebSockets, SSE is a one-way communication of server to clients (WebSockets is a bidirectional communication between server and client). 
As such, if you only need clients to receive data from a server, and don't require them sending messagess back, SSE could be a simpler way to make that happen. An online stock quotes, or notifications and feeds are good examples for applications that use SSE.

### Using Tyk as a server-sent events (SSE) Proxy

Tyk Gateway supports SSE proxying over HTTP, and can sit in the middle between the client and the SSE server and support the server sending updates to the client.

#### Setup
- Enable SSE support on the Gateway: Set `http_server_options.enable_websockets` to `true` in your Tyk Gateway config file.
- To maintain an open connection between the API consumer and the Tyk Gateway, set `http_server_options.read_timeout` and `http_server_options.write_timeout` to appropriately high values (in milliseconds). For example, you could try setting both to `2000`, but this is for you to determine in your environment.
- Set `http_server_options.flush_interval` to an appropriate value, e.g. `1`, to force Tyk to stream the response to the client every `n` seconds.


#### Example using Tyk as an SSE proxy
For this we will need:

* An SSE server.  For this example we will use [Golang HTML 5 SSE example](https://github.com/kljensen/golang-html5-sse-example)
* An instance of the Tyk Gateway and optionally the Tyk Dashboard

**Steps for Configuration:**
* Ensure the Gateway configurations detailed in the Setup section are set.
* Run the SSE server as per the example instructions. By default this runs on port `8000`.
```
go run ./server.go
```
* Publish an API with the following configuration:
    1. Set an appropriate listen path, e.g. `"listen_path": "/sse"`
    2. Strip the listen path, e.g. `"strip_listen_path": true,`
    3. Set the target url as the SSE server, e.g. the example SSE server:`"target_url": "http://host.docker.internal:8000"`
    4. Click Save, and wait for the Gateway to reload the API before testing it
* To test the protected SSE service via the API in the Tyk Gateway run:
```bash 
curl http://localhost:8080/sse/events/
```
You should see a stream of updates from the server. In this example, you will see:
