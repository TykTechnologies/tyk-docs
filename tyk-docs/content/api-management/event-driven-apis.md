## Overview

We are excited to introduce our new product, *Tyk Streams*! 
*Tyk Streams* is a powerful new feature in the Tyk API management platform that enables organizations to securely expose,
manage and monetize real-time event streams and asynchronous APIs.

With *Tyk Streams*, you can easily connect to event brokers and streaming platforms, such as
[Apache Kafka](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pro-docker-demo/tree/kafka), and expose them as
managed API endpoints to internal and external consumers.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
{{< img src="/img/streams/tyk-streams-overview.png" alt="Tyk Streams Overview" width="670px" height="500px" >}}
</div>

The purpose of Tyk Streams is to provide a unified platform for managing both synchronous APIs (such as REST and
GraphQL) and asynchronous APIs, in addition to event-driven architectures. This allows organizations to leverage the
full potential of their event-driven systems while maintaining the same level of security, control and visibility they
expect from their API management solution.



### How Tyk Streams Enables Async API Support?

Tyk Streams seamlessly integrates with the Tyk API Gateway, allowing you to manage asynchronous APIs and event streams
alongside your existing synchronous APIs. It provides a range of capabilities to support async API management, including:

- **Protocol Mediation**: Tyk Streams can mediate between different asynchronous protocols and API styles, such as WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Webhooks. This allows you to expose your event streams in a format that is compatible with your consumers' requirements.
- **Security**: Apply the same security policies and controls to your async APIs as you do to your synchronous APIs. This includes features like authentication and authorization.
- **Transformations**: Transform and enrich your event data on the fly using Tyk's powerful middleware and plugin system. This allows you to adapt your event streams to meet the needs of different consumers.
- **Analytics**: Monitor the usage and performance of your async APIs with detailed analytics and reporting. Gain insights into consumer behavior and system health.
- **Developer Portal**: Publish your async APIs to the Tyk Developer Portal, providing a centralised catalog for discovery, documentation and subscription management.


##### Configuration as Code

Tyk Streams configuration natively integrates with Tyk OAS (our OpenAPI format for APIs), enabling *configuration-as-code*
approach. This allows async API definitions to be version-controlled, collaborated on and deployed using GitOps workflows.

```yaml
{
  "openapi": "3.0.3",
  "info": {
    "title": "test-api",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  …
  "x-tyk-streaming": {
    "streams": {
      "test": {
        "input": {
          "kafka": {
            "addresses": ["TODO"],
            "topics": ["foo", "bar"],
            "consumer_group": "foogroup"
          }
        },
        "output": {
          "http_server": {
            "consumer_group": "$tyk_context.request_ip",
            "ws_path": "/subscribe"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  …
}
```



### Configuring Async APIs via Dashboard UI

The Tyk Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for defining and managing async APIs. You can easily specify event
broker details, subscribe to specific topics or channels, configure security policies, transformations and other API
management capabilities.

{{< button_left href="https://survey.hsforms.com/1ItPCBg-_Tre8WFJZL4pp6Q3ifmg" color="green" content="Get started with Tyk Streams" >}}

## Use Cases

Tyk Streams brings full lifecycle API management to asynchronous APIs and event-driven architectures. It provides a
comprehensive set of capabilities to secure, transform, monitor and monetize your async APIs.

### Security

[Tyk Streams]({{< ref "api-management/event-driven-apis#" >}}) supports all the authentication and authorization options available for traditional synchronous APIs. This
ensures that your async APIs are protected with the same level of security as your REST, GraphQL, and other API types.

- **Authentication**: Tyk supports multiple authentication methods for async APIs, including:

    - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0)
    - Basic authentication
    - Custom authentication plugins

- **Authorization**: Tyk enables fine-grained access control for async APIs based on policies and user roles. You can define granular permissions for specific topics, events or message types. 

### Transformations and Enrichment

[Tyk Streams]({{< ref "api-management/event-driven-apis#" >}}) allows you to transform and enrich the messages flowing through your async APIs. You can modify message payloads, filter events, combine data from multiple sources and more.

- **Transformation**: Use Tyk's powerful middleware and plugin system to transform message payloads on the fly. You can convert between different data formats (e.g., JSON to XML), filter fields, or apply custom logic.
- **Enrichment**: Enrich your async API messages with additional data from external sources. For example, you can lookup customer information from a database and append it to the message payload.

### Analytics and Monitoring

Tyk provides comprehensive analytics and monitoring capabilities for async APIs. You can track usage metrics, monitor performance, and gain visibility into the health of your event-driven systems.
Tyk captures detailed analytics data for async API usage, including message rates, latency, and error counts. This data can be exported to popular analytics platforms like Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and StatsD.

### Monetization

[Tyk Streams]({{< ref "api-management/event-driven-apis#" >}}) enables you to monetize your async APIs by exposing them through the Developer Portal. Developers can discover, subscribe to and consume your async APIs using webhooks or streaming subscriptions.

- **Developer Portal Integration**: Async APIs can be published to the Tyk Developer Portal, allowing developers to browse, subscribe, and access documentation. Developers can manage their async API subscriptions just like traditional APIs.
- **Webhooks**: Tyk supports exposing async APIs as webhooks, enabling developers to receive event notifications via HTTP callbacks. Developers can configure their webhook endpoints and subscribe to specific events or topics.

With [Tyk Streams]({{< ref "api-management/event-driven-apis#" >}}), you can easily monetize your async APIs, provide a seamless developer experience, and manage the entire lifecycle of your event-driven architecture.


### Complex Event Processing

Tyk Streams allows you to perform complex event processing on streams of events in real-time. You can define custom processing logic to:

- Filter events based on specific criteria
- Aggregate and correlate events from multiple streams
- Enrich events with additional data from other sources
- Detect patterns and sequences of events
- Trigger actions or notifications based on event conditions

Here's an example of a Tyk Streams configuration that performs complex event processing, specifically it creates a new event stream, which filters high-value orders and enriches them with customer email addresses, by making an additional HTTP request.
 
```yaml
input:
  kafka:
    addresses:
      - "localhost:9092" # Replace with actual Kafka broker addresses
    consumer_group: my-group
    topics:
      - orders
output:
  http_server:
    allowed_verbs:
      - GET
    path: /high-value-orders
pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
        root = if this.order_value > 1000 {
          this
        } else {
          deleted()
        }
    - branch:
        processors:
          - http:
              headers:
                Content-Type: application/json
              url: http://customer-api.local/emails
              verb: POST
        request_map: |-
          root = {
            "customer_id": this.customer_id
          }
        result_map: root.customer_email = this.customer_email
    - bloblang: |
        root = this.merge({ "high_value_order": true })
```

In this example:

- **Tyk Streams Setup**: Consumes events from a Kafka topic called *orders*.
- **Processor Block Configuration**: Utilizes a custom Bloblang script that performs the following operations:
    - **Filters** orders, only processing those with a value greater than 1000.
    - **Enriches** the high-value orders by retrieving the customer ID and email from a separate data source.
    - **Adds** a new high_value_order flag to each qualifying event.
- **Output Handling**: Processed high-value order events are exposed via a WebSocket stream at the endpoint */high-value-orders*.

### Legacy Modernization

Tyk Streams can help you modernise legacy applications and systems by exposing their functionality as async APIs. This allows you to:
- Decouple legacy systems from modern consumers
- Enable real-time, event-driven communication with legacy apps
- Gradually migrate away from legacy infrastructure

Here's an example of exposing a legacy application as an async API using Tyk Streams:

```yaml
input:
  http_client:
    url: "http://legacy-app/orders"
    verb: GET
    rate_limit: "60s"
pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
        root.order_id = this.id
        root.total = this.total
        root.timestamp = this.timestamp
output:
  kafka:
    addresses: ["localhost:9092"]
    topic: "orders"
```

In this configuration:
- Tyk Streams periodically polls the legacy */orders* REST endpoint every 60 seconds
- The *processor* transforms the legacy response format into a simplified event structure
- The transformed events are published to a Kafka topic called *orders*, which can be consumed by modern applications

### Async API Orchestration

Tyk Streams enables you to orchestrate multiple async APIs and services into composite event-driven flows. You can:
- Combine events from various streams and sources
- Implement complex routing and mediation logic between async APIs
- Create reactive flows triggered by event conditions
- Fanout events to multiple downstream consumers

Here's an example async API orchestration with Tyk Streams:

```yaml
input:
  broker:
    inputs:
      - kafka:
          addresses: ["localhost:9092"]
          topics: ["stream1"]
          consumer_group: "group1"
      - kafka:
          addresses: ["localhost:9092"]
          topics: ["stream2"]
          consumer_group: "group2"
pipeline:
  processors:
    - switch:
        cases:
          - check: 'meta("kafka_topic") == "stream1"'
            processors:
              - bloblang: |
                  root.type = "event_from_stream1"
                  root.details = this
              - branch:
                  processors:
                    - http:
                        url: "http://api1.example.com/process"
                        verb: POST
                        body: '${! json() }'
                  result_map: 'root.api1_response = this'
          - check: 'meta("kafka_topic") == "stream2"'
            processors:
              - bloblang: |
                  root.type = "event_from_stream2"
                  root.details = this
              - branch:
                  processors:
                    - http:
                        url: "http://api2.example.com/analyze"
                        verb: POST
                        body: '${! json() }'
                  result_map: 'root.api2_response = this'
    - bloblang: 'root = if this.type == "event_from_stream1" && this.api1_response.status == "ok" { this } else if this.type == "event_from_stream2" && this.api2_response.status == "ok" { this } else { deleted() }'
output:
  broker:
    pattern: "fan_out"
    outputs:
      - kafka:
          addresses: ["localhost:9092"]
          topic: "processed_stream1"
          client_id: "tyk_fanout1"
      - kafka:
          addresses: ["localhost:9092"]
          topic: "processed_stream2"
          client_id: "tyk_fanout2"
      - http_client:
          url: "https://webhook.site/unique-id"
          verb: POST
          body: '${! json() }'
```

1. **Input Configuration**
    - Uses a broker to combine events from two different Kafka topics, stream1 and stream2, allowing for the integration of events from various streams.
2. **Complex Routing and Processing**
    - A switch processor directs messages based on their origin (differentiated by Kafka topic metadata).
    - Each stream’s messages are processed and conditionally sent to different APIs.
    - Responses from these APIs are captured and used to further decide on message processing.
3. **Reactive Flows**
    - Conditions based on API responses determine if messages are forwarded or discarded, creating a flow reactive to the content and success of API interactions.
    - Fanout to Multiple Consumers:
    - The broker output with a fan_out pattern sends processed messages to multiple destinations: two different Kafka topics and an HTTP endpoint, demonstrating the capability to distribute events to various downstream consumers.

These are just a few examples of the advanced async API scenarios made possible with Tyk Streams. The platform provides a flexible and extensible framework to design, deploy and manage sophisticated event-driven architectures.

- Policies and keys for authentication and access control.

You can now use the **Key ID** to securely access the API for your applications.




## Glossary

### Event

An event represents a significant change or occurrence within a system, such as a user action, a sensor reading, or a data update. Events are typically lightweight and contain minimal data, often just a unique identifier and a timestamp.

### Stream

A stream is a continuous flow of events ordered by time. Streams allow for efficient, real-time processing and distribution of events to multiple consumers.

### Publisher (or Producer)

A publisher is an application or system that generates events and sends them to a broker or event store for distribution to interested parties.

### Subscriber (or Consumer)

A subscriber is an application or system that expresses interest in receiving events from one or more streams. Subscribers can process events in real-time or store them for later consumption.

### Broker

A broker is an intermediary system that receives events from publishers, stores them, and forwards them to subscribers. Brokers decouple publishers from subscribers, allowing for scalable and flexible event-driven architectures.

### Topic (or Channel)

A topic is a named destination within a broker where events are published. Subscribers can subscribe to specific topics to receive relevant events.

capabilities. Please consult the [glossary]({{< ref "api-management/event-driven-apis#glossary" >}}) for explanations of key
terminology.

Tyk Streams is natively integrated as part of Tyk API Gateway and has no third-party dependencies.

<!-- <!TODO: Add architectural image> -->
<!-- The above diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of Tyk Streams and its integration with the Tyk API Gateway. -->
Key components in the architecture of Tyk Streams:
- **Tyk API Gateway**: The core API management platform that handles API requests, applies policies, and routes requests
to the appropriate backend services.
- **Tyk Streams**: An extension to the Tyk API Gateway that enables support for asynchronous APIs and event-driven
architectures.
- **Event Brokers**: External systems such as Apache Kafka, MQTT brokers, or WebSocket servers that produce and consume
events.
- **Backend Services**: The underlying services and systems that expose APIs or consume events.

## Key Concepts

### Tyk Streams as middleware in Tyk API Gateway

Tyk Streams operates as middleware within the Tyk API Gateway, providing the following functionalities:

- **Middleware**: Tyk Streams introduces new middleware components that handle async-specific functionality such as
protocol mediation, event transformations, and pub/sub messaging.
- **API Definitions**: Tyk Streams is configured using the standard Tyk OAS format, including additional fields tailored
for async protocols and event configurations.
- **Analytics**: Async API traffic is captured and reported via *Prometheus*, *OpenTelemetry* or *StatsD*, providing
visibility into usage, performance, and errors.

### Connectors and Protocol Mediation

Tyk Streams provides out-of-the-box connectors for popular event brokers and async protocols, including:

- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
- [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) (Coming Soon)
- [Solace](https://docs.solace.com/Get-Started/Solace-PubSub-Platform.htm) (Coming Soon)
- [AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/) (Coming Soon)
- [WebSocket](https://websocket.org/guides/websocket-protocol/)
- [Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE)
- [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook)

In addition to the native protocol support, Tyk Streams offers powerful protocol mediation capabilities. This allows you
to expose async APIs using different protocols than the backend event broker, making it easier to support a diverse client
requirements.

For example, you can:
- Expose a Kafka topic as a WebSocket API
- Convert MQTT messages to HTTP webhooks
- Bridge between different async protocols (e.g., Kafka to MQTT)



## Deployment Considerations

When deploying Tyk Streams, understanding its scaling and performance capabilities, as well as its high availability features, is crucial for ensuring a robust and efficient API infrastructure.

### Scaling and Performance

Tyk Streams is fully embedded within the Tyk Gateway, enabling seamless scaling and high performance. As your API traffic grows, Tyk Streams scales effortlessly alongside your Tyk Gateway instances. No additional configuration or separate infrastructure is required.

Key benefits of this embedded architecture include:

- **Unified scaling**: Tyk Streams inherits the scaling capabilities of Tyk Gateway, ensuring optimal performance as your API workload increases.
- **Efficient resource utilization**: By leveraging the same infrastructure as Tyk Gateway, Tyk Streams minimizes resource overhead and simplifies deployment.
- **Seamless integration**: Tyk Streams works seamlessly with existing Tyk Gateway deployments, requiring no changes to your current architecture.

### High Availability

Tyk Streams ensures reliable message delivery across a cluster of Tyk Gateway instances. Whether clients connect through a load balancer or directly to individual gateway nodes, Tyk Streams guarantees that messages are delivered to each connected consumer.

Under the hood, Tyk Streams utilizes [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/) for efficient and reliable message distribution within the Tyk Gateway cluster. This enables:

- **Fault tolerance**: If a gateway node fails, clients connected to other nodes continue to receive messages uninterrupted.
- **Load balancing**: Messages are evenly distributed across the gateway cluster, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.
- **Message persistence**: Redis Streams provides durability, allowing messages to be persisted and replayed if necessary.

By leveraging the high availability features of Tyk Gateway and Redis Streams, Tyk Streams delivers a robust and resilient solution for managing and distributing async API messages in production environments.

With Tyk Streams, you can confidently deploy and scale your async APIs, knowing that messages will be reliably delivered to consumers across your Tyk Gateway cluster.



## Developer Portal Integration

Tyk Streams seamlessly integrates with the Tyk Developer Portal, enabling developers to easily discover, subscribe to, and consume async APIs and event streams. This section covers how to publish async APIs to the developer portal, provide documentation and enable developers to subscribe to events and streams.



### Publishing Async APIs to the Developer Portal

Publishing async APIs to the Tyk Developer Portal follows a similar process to publishing traditional synchronous APIs. API publishers can create API products that include async APIs and make them available to developers through the portal.

To publish an async API:
- In the Tyk Dashboard, create a new API and define the async API endpoints and configuration.
- Associate the async API with an API product.
- Publish the API product to the Developer Portal.
- Copy code

### Async API Documentation

Providing clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for developers to understand and effectively use async APIs. While Tyk Streams does not currently support the AsyncAPI specification format, it allows API publishers to include detailed documentation for each async API.

When publishing an async API to the Developer Portal, consider including the following information in the documentation:
- Overview and purpose of the async API
- Supported protocols and endpoints (e.g., WebSocket, Webhook)
- Event types and payloads
- Subscription and connection details
- Example code snippets for consuming the async API
- Error handling and troubleshooting guidelines

### Enabling Developers to Subscribe to Events and Streams

Tyk Streams provides a seamless way for developers to subscribe to events and streams directly from the Developer Portal. API publishers can enable webhook subscriptions for specific API products, allowing developers to receive real-time updates and notifications.
To enable webhook subscriptions for an API product:
1. In the Tyk Developer Portal, navigate to the API product settings.
2. Enable the "Webhooks" option and specify the available events for subscription.
3. Save the API product settings.

<!-- [Placeholder for screenshot showing the API product settings with webhook configuration] -->

Once webhook subscriptions are enabled, developers can subscribe to events and streams by following these steps:
- In the Developer Portal, navigate to the My Apps page.
- Select the desired app.
- In the "Webhooks" section, click on "Subscribe".
- Provide the necessary details:
    - *Webhook URL*: The URL where the event notifications will be sent.
    - *HMAC Secret*: Provide a secret key used to sign the webhook messages for authentication.
    - *Events*: Select the specific events to subscribe to.
- Save the subscription settings.
- Copy code
<!-- [Placeholder for screenshot illustrating the developer's view of subscribing to webhooks] -->

{{< img src="/img/streams/subscribe-webhooks.png" alt="subscribe to webhooks from portal" width="1000" >}}

To configure the async API stream for webhook subscriptions, use the following output configuration in your API definition:

```yaml
outputs:
  - portal_webhook:
      event_type: bar
      portal_url: http://localhost:3001
      secret: <portal-api-secret>
```

Replace *<portal-api-secret>* with the actual secret key used for signing the webhook messages.

By enabling webhook subscriptions, developers can easily integrate real-time updates and notifications from async APIs into their applications, enhancing the overall developer experience and facilitating seamless communication between systems.
