## Introduction

Managing APIs across multiple environments can quickly become complex. Updating and overseeing multiple configurations, security policies, and deployments requires a significant amount of effort without the right tools. Tyk’s suite of automation tools simplifies this process by enabling automated control over API management tasks, helping teams ensure reliability, reduce manual errors, and maintain consistency across deployments.

In this page, we’ll walk through the primary tools for automating API management with Tyk, including:

* **Tyk Operator for Kubernetes**: Automate API deployments within Kubernetes environments.
* **Tyk Sync**: Sync configurations across environments for consistent API management.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into lifecycle automations with Tyk, ensure you have the following:

- **A Tyk installation** (Self-Managed or Cloud)
  - If you don't have Tyk installed, follow our [installation guide]({{<ref "tyk-self-managed#installation-options-for-tyk-self-managed">}})
  - For Tyk Cloud, sign up [here](https://tyk.io/sign-up/)
  - Tyk Operator license key. Starting from Tyk Operator v1.0, a valid license key is required.

- **Access to a Kubernetes cluster v1.19+** (for Tyk Operator sections)
  - If you're new to Kubernetes, check out the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

- **Helm 3+** (for installing Tyk Operator)
  - If you don't have Helm installed, follow the [official Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
  - Verify your installation by running `helm version` in your terminal

- **Tyk Dashboard v3+ access** (for Tyk Sync setup)
  - Learn how to set up the Tyk Dashboard [here]({{<ref "tyk-dashboard">}})

- **Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, YAML** (important for Tyk Operator and Tyk Sync)
  - For Kubernetes, visit the [official tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)
  - For YAML, check out this [YAML tutorial](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)

If you're missing any of these prerequisites, please follow the provided links to set up the necessary components before proceeding with the lifecycle automation steps.
