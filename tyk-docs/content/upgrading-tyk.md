## Standards and recommendations
Our upgrade process adheres to the following standards:

- **Breaking changes:** Breaking changes are rare and will be explicitly stated in the release notes.
- **Configuration files:** Upgrades do not overwrite your configuration files. However, it’s good practice to routinely back up these files (using git or another tool) before upgrading, so any customizations are saved.
- **Migration scripts:** Migration scripts for your APIs, policies, or other assets are generally not required unless specified in the release notes.
- **Long Term Support:** Refer to our [versioning and long-term support policies]({{< ref "developer-support/release-notes/special-releases#long-term-support-releases" >}}) for details on major and minor releases, patches, and support dates.
- **Preparations:** Review the [preparation guidelines]({{< ref "developer-support/upgrading-tyk/preparations/upgrade-guidelines" >}}) before starting the upgrade.
- **Release notes:** Always check the "Upgrade Instructions" section in the relevant release notes.
- **Backups:** Follow our [comprehensive backup guide]({{< ref "frequently-asked-questions/how-to-backup-tyk" >}}) before starting the upgrade.
- Docker: Upgrading with Docker is straightforward—pull the new images from public repositories. Refer to the following links for our releases:
