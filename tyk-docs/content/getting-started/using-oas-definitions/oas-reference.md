Tyk Gateway is extremely flexible with a great many features that you can use to configure and optimize the handling of requests to your APIs. During the [Early Access]({{< ref "developer-support/release-notes/special-releases#early-access-features" >}}) phase, we gradually rolled out support for the configuration that is available through Tyk Classic API definitions into the new Tyk OAS API Definition format.

From Tyk Gateway and Dashboard v5.3.0 we have reached feature maturity, however there are still a few features to be added before we reach and surpass feature parity with Tyk Classic API.

In the tables below, *Implemented* means that the feature is available for use with Tyk OAS APIs while using the Tyk Gateway API or Tyk Dashboard API; the *API Designer* column shows the features that can be configured using the Tyk Dashboard UI.

If there's a feature you're looking to use that isn't yet implemented, let us know via our [community forum](https://community.tyk.io/t/oas-has-landed/5605) or your Tyk representative and help us to help you get started with Tyk OAS.
