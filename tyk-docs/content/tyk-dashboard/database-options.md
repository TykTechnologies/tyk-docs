## Introduction
Tyk Dashboard requires a persistent datastore for its operations. By default MongoDB is used. From Tyk v4.0, we also support PostgreSQL. 

## MongoDB Supported Versions and Drop-in Replacement

{{< include "mongodb-versions-include" >}}

### Configuring MongoDB

Please check [here]({{< ref "planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb.md" >}}) for MongoDB driver and production configurations.

## PostgreSQL Supported Versions and Drop-in Replacement

{{< include "sql-versions-include" >}}

{{< note success >}}
**Note** 

Starting from 5.7.0, SQLite support will be deprecated. To avoid disrputions, please transition to either PostgreSQL or MongoDB as alternative database options
{{< /note >}}

### Configuring PostgreSQL

Please check [here]({{< ref "planning-for-production/database-settings/postgresql.md" >}}) for production configurations.

See the following pages for configuring your SQL installation with Tyk:

* [Configuring Tyk Dashboard]({{< ref "/content/planning-for-production/database-settings/postgresql.md" >}})
* [Configuring Tyk Pumps]({{< ref "/content/planning-for-production/database-settings/postgresql.md" >}})

All data stored in SQL platforms will be identical to our existing MongoDB support.

## Which platform should you use?

We recommend the following:

* For PoC installations, you can use any of the following platforms (SQLite, PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
* For production installations, we **only** support MongoDB or PostgreSQL
