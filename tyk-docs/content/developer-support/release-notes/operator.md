#### Changelog {#Changelog-v0.17.1}

##### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed ApiDefinition Custom Resources generated by the Ingress Controller used a wrong certificate</summary>

When using Tyk as an Ingress Controller with TLS enabled, the ApiDefinition Custom Resources generated by the Ingress Controller is missing the OrgID field. As a result, Tyk Gateway used a wrong certificate when serving a request. It is fixed by adding back OrgID field to ApiDefinition CRs created by Ingress Controller.</summary>
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Added Webhook and RBAC port configurations in Tyk Operator Helm chart</summary>

Users can configure Tyk Operator webhook and RBAC port via helm chart values `.Values.webhookPort` and `.Values.rbac.port` respectively.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Addressed security vulnerabilities CVE-2023-45288</summary>

Addressed security vulnerabilities [CVE-2023-45288](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288) where an attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.

<li>
<details>
<summary>Addressed security vulnerabilities CVE-2024-24786</summary>

Addressed security vulnerabilities [CVE-2024-24786](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24786) where the `protojson.Unmarshal` function can enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON. This condition can occur when unmarshaling into a message which contains a `google.protobuf.Any` value, or when the `UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown` option is set.
