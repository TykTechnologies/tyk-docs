### Changelog {#Changelog-v1.28.0}

#### Added

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>2025 Tyk Cloud Pricing Plans Introduced</summary>

Tyk Cloud has introduced the 2025 base pricing plans, featuring new Core, Professional, and Enterprise tiers. These changes provide clearer value differentiation across plans while maintaining flexibility for both SaaS and Hybrid deployments. The "Account" section is now hidden for new customers, though existing customers remain unaffected. Usage and quota are still available in the "System Usage" and "Monitoring" sections. For more information, please check the [Pricing & Plans](https://tyk.io/pricing/)

</details>
</li> 
</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>
  
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Validation for Hybrid Data Plane Names</summary>

We’ve fixed an issue where pasting invalid characters, such as tabs and spaces, into the hybrid data plane name field would break the registration flow in Ara. The system now includes input validation on both the frontend and backend, ensuring only valid characters are accepted. This prevents configuration issues and improves the reliability of the hybrid data plane creation process.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Login Handling in Tyk Cloud</summary>

We’ve made backend improvements to the Tyk Cloud login functionality to enhance its security and resilience against automated attacks. These changes help ensure a more consistent and secure authentication experience.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Secure Defaults Aligned Across Dashboard Versions</summary>

We’ve fixed an issue where secure configuration defaults for the Tyk Dashboard admin view were not properly applied in older versions (v5.3). These settings now default to true in v5.8+ as intended, while remaining false in v5.3 to preserve backward compatibility. This ensures consistent and expected security behavior across versions.

**Note:** Changes in deployment configurations are applied during a redeployment, triggered by the user or system. In addition, defaults can be changed individually by creating a support ticket.

</details>
</li>

</ul>

## 1.26.0 Release Notes

### Release Date 17 of March 2025

### Release Highlights

Tyk Cloud now provides greater compliance controls, allowing customers to manage audit logging and storage more effectively. With new audit log storage and the ability to enable or disable audit logging per Control Plane deployment, users can optimize costs while maintaining security and compliance. These improvements give organizations more flexibility in handling audit data based on their specific regulatory and operational needs. To enable this feature, please contact your account manager.

#### Admin Behavior Update in Control Planes v5.8.0
In the next Tyk Cloud release, starting with the Control Planes version 5.8.0, we will be  restricting Tyk Dashboard admin users' ability to view and reset other users' API tokens. This change will automatically apply to all Control Plane deployments that are either newly created with or upgraded to version 5.8.0 or later.

This security improvement helps protect sensitive access credentials and provides better isolation between user accounts. If your organization requires the previous behavior for specific operational needs, you can revert this change by submitting a request to Tyk Support.

We remain committed to continuously improving the security of our platform while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse environments.

### Changelog {#Changelog-v1.26.0}

#### Added

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enable/Disable Audit Logging for Control Plane Deployments</summary>

Tyk Cloud allows users to enable or disable audit logging for their [Control Plane]({{< ref "api-management/mdcb#data-plane" >}}) (CP) deployments, providing greater flexibility in managing compliance and storage costs. To enable this feature, please contact your account manager.

Tyk Cloud now also enforces audit log storage quotas based on contractual terms (a storage quota limit assigned to organizations based on their subscription), allowing customers to manage costs effectively. Similar to analytics storage, a size cap is applied to audit logs, dropping the oldest logs to fit the new ones within the quota.

For more information, please check the [Tyk Dashboard documentation on the feature](https://tyk.io/docs/api-management/dashboard-configuration/#retrieving-audit-logs-via-api)

</details>
</li>  

<li>

</details>
</li>
  
</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Protecting Go Plugin Functionality by Isolating MServ API Definitions</summary>

Tyk Cloud now moves MServ API definitions to a separate organization, preventing users from accidentally modifying or deleting them. Previously, these definitions were stored within the customer’s Tyk Dashboard deployment, posing the risk of breaking Go plugin functionality. With this update, Go plugins remain fully operational while deployments become more secure and error-proof. This change applies to new deployments only; existing deployments with plugins enabled will be gradually migrated in the future to avoid unexpected service disruption.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Provision First and Last Name for Cloud SSO Users</summary>

Tyk Cloud now correctly populates first and last names when provisioning new users via SSO (Google SSO, KeyCloak). Previously, only the first name was set, causing validation errors when updating roles due to a missing last name. This fix ensures that SSO-provisioned users have complete profiles, preventing onboarding issues and improving role management for organizations

</details>
</li>    

<li>
<details>
<summary>Enforce 'Only Registered Users' Flag for SSO in Tyk Cloud</summary>

Tyk Cloud now correctly enforces the 'Only Registered Users' flag for SSO (Google SSO, KeyCloak), preventing the creation of unregistered users via just-in-time provisioning. Previously, users without a corresponding local entry could still be created even when this setting was enabled.

</details>
</li>    

<li>
<details>
<summary>Incorrect Display of Custom Domain Field in EDP</summary>

Tyk Cloud now correctly hides the custom domain field in the Enterprise Developer Portal (EDP) edit page when the custom domain entitlement is not enabled. Previously, the field was visible even for organizations without access to this feature, causing confusion.

</details>
</li> 

<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Probes for Control Plane Deployments with SSO</summary>

Tyk Cloud now ensures more reliable health checks for Control Plane deployments when SSO is configured.

</details>
</li> 

<li>
<details>
<summary>Accurate Subscription Limits in Monitoring Charts</summary>

The monitoring chart in Tyk Cloud now correctly displays the subscription limit based on the organization’s entitlement.

</details>
</li> 

<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Analytics Performance in Tyk Cloud</summary>

Changing the analytics storage quota in Tyk Cloud no longer removes critical database indices, which previously led to performance degradation. This fix ensures that indices are preserved, maintaining fast query performance and data integrity. Customers should now experience improved analytics performance, especially when adjusting storage quotas.

</details>
</li> 

</ul>

The behavior for accessing the billing app through the 'Upgrade' and 'Account & Billing' buttons has been standardized.

<summary>Fix for hybrid codes visibility logic to manage node data retention</summary>

The fix ensures that we only contains records from the last 7 days.
