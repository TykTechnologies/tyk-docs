This document is intended for Tyk users, contributors, and anyone interested in our commitment to [inclusive language](#inclusive-naming-project) within Tyk's documentation and product interfaces.

## How to Contribute to Tyk Docs

We appriciate any form of engagement and contribution to our documentation. You can do it in a few ways:
- [Report an error](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs/issues) in our Github repo.
- [Suggest/request an improvement](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs/issues) in our Github repo.
- Post a message in our [community forum](https://community.tyk.io/)
- Update the code yourself:
  1. If you want to be even more involved, you are welcomed to [submit PR](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs/pulls) directly in our [docs repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs/).
  2. In order for you need to find the page that needs editing in the actual [GH docs repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs/), the best way would be to copy a sentence from that HTML page on the [docs website](https://tyk.io/docs) and look it up it using the Github search box, on the top left corner. (Since the structure of our docs is not the same as the structure in the rendered docs website, we can't easily link you to this page).

There are two ways to update the docs:

- **GitHub GUI Browser**: This is the easiest way to make simple edits and contributions to the docs. It allows you to edit files directly in the browser, commit changes, and create pull requests (PRs) without needing to set up a local development environment.

- **Local Development Environment**: This is the recommended way to contribute to the docs when you need to make more complex changes, test your changes in real-time, or work on multiple files. It involves cloning the Tyk docs repository to your local machine, setting up a development environment, and running the Mintlify CLI to preview your changes before committing them.

### GitHub GUI Browser
Contributing to the docs via the browser is fast and easy. 
GH provides great DX for making updates, committing and creating PRs via the browser. The DX for reviewing PRs is also pretty powerful.

#### When To Use it?
Use GitHub GUI browser when you:
- Have simple and only a few edits of the markdown files. 
- Already know the syntax for adding internal links and adding images. 
- Already know what you are going to write and you **don't** need many iterative commits to see if the result looks okay. In this case, using a local environment will be much faster as explained in the next section.

#### How To Use It?
I'll briefly explain the process as it is quite straightforward:
1. Via the GUI you can simply click the pencil icon to start editing, then check the differences, click commit to commit the changes to a new branch, and eventually create a PR. 
2. Check that the CI jobs started running. These jobs run tests on the website including your changes. Running CI jobs are displayed in yellow. 
3. Once the CI job finishes it will turn green. Upon completion, you will see a preview link that you should use to check your changes on a real deployment of the Tyk docs website.


### Local Development Environment
Local environment means checking out the tyk-docs repo and updating the files using an editor or an IDE. This allows you to test your changes by running Mintlify locally and check for errors both in the Mintlify process and in the website that Mintlify generates.

#### When To Use It?
Using the browser is not always enough and you sometimes need to check out the repo and work locally.
You normally favor using a local environment when you need to:
- Test your changes in real-time before pushing them
- Repeatedly make changes and test the website

Doing so by **running Mintlify locally will save you a lot of time** since it takes the CI a few minutes to update the deployment with the latest changes and complete its tests before showing a green success status.

#### Use Cases For Local Development Environment
When you need to:
- Preview changes and verify their appearance locally
- Check that the images you added work correctly
- See how images are rendered on the page
- Check that the internal links you added work
- When you are not sure about the syntax of links or images when working on many pages
- When adding new files, it's easier to run Mintlify locally because you need to validate the format of internal links and references to other content pages and sections

#### How To Use It?

For internal Tyklings the recommended way to contribute is from a pull request branch in the [tyk-docs](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs) repository.

For external contributions, we recommend contributing to Tyk in the following way:

- Fork this repository
- Clone the forked repository on your machine
- Create a remote branch, e.g `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs.git`
- Fetch from the remote branch `git fetch upstream`
- Rebase your branch with the latest remote branch content `git rebase upstream/master`

## Inclusive Naming project
We are excited to announce the launch of our *Inclusive Naming* project, in June 2024, dedicated to updating our documentation and aligning with the [Inclusive Naming Initiative (INI)](https://inclusivenaming.org). This initiative reflects our commitment to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for our users and within our company.

The [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org/) is a community-driven effort to promote and standardize the use of inclusive language in software and documentation. By adhering to their guidelines, we aim to eliminate terms that can be considered exclusionary, offensive, or insensitive and replace them with language that is respectful and welcoming to all.

**Purpose**

Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is foundational to our values. By updating our documentation to comply with the *Inclusive Naming Initiative (INI)*, we are taking a significant step towards ensuring that our language reflects our dedication to inclusivity. This project will help us:

- **Create a more welcoming environment**: By using inclusive language, we create a space where everyone feels valued and respected.
- **Enhance accessibility**: Clear and inclusive documentation improves accessibility for all users, regardless of their background or identity.

### Tier 1 word list

INI sorts terms into word lists, considering both the severity of the term and the level of scrutiny it has received. [INI Tier 1 words](https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/tier-1) are considered critical and are recommended to be replaced immediately.

INI has identified that terms included in this list have one or all of the following attributes:

- Strong social consensus within the software development community on replacements
- Are identified by the INI as high-severity terms in need of immediate replacement
- Terms where the impact of change or removal is low: for example, there is little entanglement in low-level systems or standardized language set by standards bodies
- Have passed through all the review stages in Tiers 2 and 3

### Phase #1: Review of Tyk Documentation for Tier 1 Words

An initial review of the Tyk documentation was conducted in April 2024 to check which tier 1 words can be replaced, which can't, and why.

#### Findings and planning
The main findings of the review are:

1. **Explanatory content with INI tier 1 words**: The content on these pages can be easily rephrased and is now completed.
2. **Configuration parameters containing INI tier 1 words**:
   - Some *INI tier 1 words* are embedded in the code as part of the name of parameters, fields, and keywords.
   - These words are sourced from Tyk products, and third-party libraries, and tooling, e.g. Redis.
   - Possible actions:
     - Being part of the source code, we can't simply rephrase and use a different terminology. Such change requires following a deprecation process to ensure there are no breaking changes for our users.
     - For now, we can minimize their usage and rephrase the explanatory content to use inclusive words.

   
### Phase #2: Removing Tier 1 words from Tyk documentation

In June 2024, based on the review we executed the planned changes to the content in our [documentation](https://github.com/tykTechnologies/tyk-docs/).

#### Status update
This is the update on the status of our documentation
1. **Regular explanatory content with INI tier 1 words**: Content in the documentation has been rephrased and the work is now completed. 
2. **Configuration parameters containing INI tier 1 words**: These words are still in our docs, however, we minimized their usage and rephrased their explanatory content to use inclusive words.
   - **Tyk products**: These words are still in our docs, however, Tyk aims to gradually replace them (in a backward-compatible way) and update the docs accordingly.
   - **Third-party and dependencies**: There's nothing much we can do at the moment except wait for them to replace these parameters, however, we are committed to updating our docs once this gets done.

#### List of configuration parameters containing INI tier 1 word
