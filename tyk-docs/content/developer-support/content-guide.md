## Introduction

Tyk documentation is built using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/), a tool that allows us to create and manage documentation. This page provides an overview of how to contribute to Tyk documentation, including how to set up your local environment, create new content, and utilize Mintlify's features.

## Getting Started

This secion provides instructions for setting up your local environment to work with Tyk documentation using Mintlify.

1. **Install Mintlify CLI globally**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g mintlify
   ```
2. **Clone the Tyk Docs repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <TODO>
   ```
3. **Navigate to the Tyk Docs directory**:
   ```bash
   cd tyk-docs
   ```
4. **Start the Mintlify development server**:
   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the documentation.

## Creating a New Page

To add a new page to the Tyk documentation, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

* You’ve set up the Tyk Docs local environment as described in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
* You have a basic understanding of [Page Structure](https://mintlify.com/docs/pages) and [Navigation](https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation) in Mintlify.
* You’re familiar with Git and Markdown syntax.

### Instructions

1. **Switch to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Create the new page:**

   The content is organized into folders under the root directory, reflecting the website's navigation structure (tabs, groups, etc.). Choose the appropriate folder for your new page.

   * Create a new `.mdx` file for the page. For example, for a page titled “API Versioning,” you might create a file named `api-versioning.mdx`.
   * Add [front matter](https://mintlify.com/docs/pages#frontmatter) to the top of the file. This is a YAML block containing metadata like the title, description, and tags.

   **Example front matter:**

   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "API Versioning"
   description: "Create and manage multiple versions of an API"
   sidebarTitle: "API Versioning"
   tags: ['API versioning', 'version', 'Tyk Classic', 'Tyk OAS', 'API', 'versioning']
   ---
   ```

   * Write your content using Markdown. You can also use Mintlify UI components (e.g., accordions, callouts, code blocks) to improve readability and user experience.

4. **Update `docs.json`:**

   To make your new page appear in the navigation, update the `docs.json` file in the root directory.

   **Example**: Adding a new page under the *"API Management"* tab in the *"Overview"* group.

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "navigation": {
       "tabs": [
         {
           "tab": "API Management",
           "groups": [
             {
               "group": "Overview",
               "pages": [
                 "tyk-overview",
                 "tyk-components",
                 "apim",
                 "api-versioning"  // New page added here
               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ...
   }
   ```

5. **Commit and push your changes:**

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Add new page: <page-name>"
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** on GitHub to merge your changes into `main`.

7. **Preview your changes** using the link provided by Mintlify before merging.
