## Introduction

Redis serves as the primary data store for various components across the Tyk Stack, handling critical functions such as key management, analytics storage, distributed rate limiting, and inter-node communication. 

**Redis is a requirement for the proper functioning of Tyk components**. For your Tyk deployments to be highly available and reliable, Tyk recommends using persistent and recoverable Redis deployments.

## Tyk Components Using Redis

| Component               | Redis Usage                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Tyk Gateway**          | Session Management, Rate Limiting, Cache, Analytics, Cluster Synchronization |
| **Tyk Dashboard**        | Session Management, API Configuration, Developer Portal, Cluster Notifications |
| **Tyk Pump**             | Analytics Processing, Uptime Data            |
| **Tyk Identity Broker**  | Profile Storage, Token Caching               |
| **MDCB**                 | Configuration Synchronization, Analytics Aggregation |

## Supported Redis Versions

[Tyk components]({{< ref "developer-support/release-notes/overview" >}}) are regularly updated to maintain compatibility with the latest [Redis versions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/release-notes/).

To check the specific Redis versions supported by each Tyk component, please refer to the release notes of your specific Tyk component and version.

## Redis Deployment Options

Tyk supports various Redis deployment configurations to meet different scalability and availability requirements:

This section provides architectural guidance for Redis deployment in Tyk [Data Plane]({{< ref "api-management/mdcb#setup-mdcb-data-plane" >}}) environments within [Multi Data Center Bridge]({{< ref "api-management/mdcb" >}}) (MDCB) configurations.

<br>

> This section is written with the MDCB data plane in mind, but the same principles apply to standalone Tyk deployments.

### 1. Standalone Redis (Basic)

A single Redis instance provides the simplest deployment model suitable for development, testing, or low-criticality environments.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Plane"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        GW1[Tyk Gateway 1]
        GW2[Tyk Gateway 2]
        GW3[Tyk Gateway N]
        Redis[(Redis Instance)]
        
        LB --> GW1
        LB --> GW2
        LB --> GW3
        
        GW1 --> Redis
        GW2 --> Redis
        GW3 --> Redis
    end
    
    subgraph "Control Plane"
        CP[MDCB Control Plane]
    end
    
    GW1 -.-> CP
    GW2 -.-> CP
    GW3 -.-> CP
```

#### Characteristics

- **[RTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective)**: 5-15 minutes (manual intervention required)
- **[RPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective)**: 0-5 minutes (depending on persistence configuration)
- **Availability**: ~99.5%
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Cost**: Lowest

#### Pros

- Simple to deploy and manage
- Minimal resource requirements
- No coordination overhead
- Suitable for containerized environments

#### Cons

- Single point of failure
- Manual recovery required
- Not suitable for production workloads
- Limited scalability

### 2. Redis Sentinel (High Availability)

[Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel/) provides automated failover capabilities with a master-replica setup, offering a good balance between availability and complexity.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Plane"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        GW1[Tyk Gateway 1]
        GW2[Tyk Gateway 2]
        GW3[Tyk Gateway N]
        
        subgraph "Redis HA Cluster"
            RM[Redis Master]
            RR1[Redis Replica 1]
            RR2[Redis Replica 2]
            S1[Sentinel 1]
            S2[Sentinel 2]
            S3[Sentinel 3]
        end
        
        LB --> GW1
        LB --> GW2
        LB --> GW3
        
        GW1 --> S1
        GW2 --> S2
        GW3 --> S3
        
        RM --> RR1
        RM --> RR2
        
        S1 -.-> RM
        S2 -.-> RM
        S3 -.-> RM
    end
    
    subgraph "Control Plane"
        CP[MDCB Control Plane]
    end
    
    GW1 -.-> CP
    GW2 -.-> CP
    GW3 -.-> CP
```

#### Characteristics

- **RTO**: 30-60 seconds (automatic failover)
- **RPO**: <1 minute (asynchronous replication)
- **Availability**: ~99.9%
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Cost**: Medium

To configure Tyk to work with Redis Sentinel, see the [Redis Sentinel configuration section]({{< ref "#configure-redis-sentinel" >}}) below.

### 3. Redis Cluster (Horizontal Scaling)

[Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling/) offers horizontal scaling capabilities through automatic sharding, making it suitable for high-throughput environments that require linear scalability.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Plane"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        GW1[Tyk Gateway 1]
        GW2[Tyk Gateway 2]
        GW3[Tyk Gateway N]
        
        subgraph "Redis Cluster"
            subgraph "Shard 1"
                RC1M[Redis Master 1]
                RC1R[Redis Replica 1]
            end
            subgraph "Shard 2"
                RC2M[Redis Master 2]
                RC2R[Redis Replica 2]
            end
            subgraph "Shard 3"
                RC3M[Redis Master 3]
                RC3R[Redis Replica 3]
            end
        end
        
        LB --> GW1
        LB --> GW2
        LB --> GW3
        
        GW1 --> RC1M
        GW1 --> RC2M
        GW1 --> RC3M
        
        RC1M --> RC1R
        RC2M --> RC2R
        RC3M --> RC3R
    end
    
    subgraph "Control Plane"
        CP[MDCB Control Plane]
    end
    
    GW1 -.-> CP
    GW2 -.-> CP
    GW3 -.-> CP
```

### Decision Matrix

The following table summarizes the key characteristics of each Redis deployment option:

| Architecture      | [RTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective)         | [RPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective)        | Availability | Complexity | Use Case                     |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|------------|------------------------------|
| Single Redis      | 5–15 min    | 0–5 min    | 99.5%        | Low        | Development/Testing           |
| Redis with Sentinel | 30–60 sec | <1 min     | 99.9%        | Medium     | Production (Standard)         |
| Redis Cluster     | 10–30 sec   | <30 sec    | 99.95%       | High       | High-throughput Production    |

## Configure Redis with TLS

If you are using TLS for Redis connections, set `use_ssl` to `true` for Gateway and Pump, and `redis_use_ssl` to `true` for the dashboard.
Redis supports [SSL/TLS encryption](https://redis.io/topics/encryption) as of version 6, making it an optional feature that enhances the security of data in transit. Similarly, Amazon ElastiCache offers encryption in transit and at rest. To configure TLS or mTLS connections between an application and Redis, consider the following settings in Tyk's configuration files:

- `storage.use_ssl`: Set this to true to enable TLS encryption for the connection.

- `storage.ssl_insecure_skip_verify`: A flag that, when set to true, instructs the application not to verify the Redis server's TLS certificate. This is not recommended for production due to the risk of `man-in-the-middle` attacks.

From **Tyk 5.3**, additional options are available for more granular control:

- `storage.ca_file`: Path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file for verifying the Redis server's certificate.

- `storage.cert_file` and `storage.key_file`: Paths to your application's certificate and private key files, necessary for mTLS where both parties verify each other's identity.

- `storage.max_version` and `storage.min_version`: Define the acceptable range of TLS versions, enhancing security by restricting connections to secure TLS protocols (1.2 or 1.3).

**Setting up an Insecure TLS Connection**
- **Enable TLS**: By setting `"use_ssl": true`, you encrypt the connection.
- **Skip Certificate Verification**: Setting `"ssl_insecure_skip_verify": true` bypasses the server's certificate verification, suitable only for non-production environments.

**Setting up a Secure TLS Connection**
- Ensure `use_ssl` is set to `true`.
- Set `ssl_insecure_skip_verify` to `false` to enforce certificate verification against the CA specified in `ca_file`.
- Specify the path to the CA file in `ca_file` for server certificate verification.
- Adjust `min_version` and `max_version` to secure TLS versions, ideally 1.2 and 1.3.

**Setting up a Mutual TLS (mTLS) Connection**
- Follow the steps for a secure TLS connection.
- Provide paths for `cert_file` and `key_file` for your application's TLS certificate and private key, enabling the Redis server to verify your application's identity.

**Example Gateway Configuration**
```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "use_ssl": true,
  "ssl_insecure_skip_verify": false,
  "ca_file": "/path/to/ca.crt",
  "cert_file": "/path/to/client.crt",
  "key_file": "/path/to/client.key",
  "max_version": "1.3",
  "min_version": "1.2",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000
}
```

## Configure Redis Cluster

Our Gateway, Dashboard, and Pump all support integration with Redis Cluster. Redis Cluster allows data to be automatically sharded across multiple Redis Nodes. To set up Redis Cluster correctly, we recommend reading the [Redis Cluster Tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial). You must use the same settings across the Gateway, Dashboard, and Pump.

**Note**  

A Redis Cluster operates differently from a standard Redis setup, where one instance serves as the primary and others as replicas.

### Redis Cluster and Tyk Gateway 

To configure the Tyk Gateway to work with your Redis Cluster, set `enable_cluster` to `true` and list your servers under `addrs` in your `tyk.conf` file.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts`, which is now deprecated. 
{{< /note >}}

If you are using TLS for Redis connections, set `use_ssl` to `true`.

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

### Redis Cluster and Tyk Dashboard

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`redis_addrs` is new in v1.9.3 for the Dashboard, and replaces `hosts`, which is now deprecated. 
{{< /note >}}


```json
"redis_addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
"redis_use_ssl": true,
"enable_cluster": true
```
To configure the Tyk Dashboard to work with your Redis Cluster, add the Redis address information to your `tyk_analytics.conf` file:


### Redis Cluster and Tyk Pump

To configure the Tyk Pump to work with your Redis Cluster, set `enable_cluster` to `true` and list your servers under `addrs` in your `pump.conf` file.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts`, which is now deprecated. 
{{< /note >}}


```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

### Redis Cluster with Docker

For Redis clustered mode to work with Tyk using Docker and Amazon ElastiCache, follow these two steps:

1. **Make sure cluster mode is enabled**

Set the environment variable `TYK_GW_STORAGE_ENABLECLUSTER` to `true`.

2. **Add all cluster endpoints to the config**

Add all the Redis Cluster endpoints into Tyk, not just the primary. If Tyk can't see the whole cluster, then it will not work.

For ElastiCache Redis, you can bypass having to list all your nodes, and instead use the *configuration endpoint*,
This allows read and write operations, and the endpoint determines the correct node to target.

If this does not work, you can still list out the hosts using an environment variable. To do so, set the environment variable:

```{.copyWrapper}
TYK_GW_STORAGE_ADDRS="redis_primary1:port,redis_replica1:port,redis_primary2:port,redis_replica2:port,redis_primary3:port,redis_replica3:port"
```

It is essential that Tyk can connect to all primary and replica instances.

It is recommended to ensure that the connection pool is big enough. To do so, set the following environment variables:

```{.copyWrapper}
TYK_GW_STORAGE_MAXIDLE=6000
TYK_GW_STORAGE_MAXACTIVE=10000
```
{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

These are suggested settings; please verify them by load testing.
{{< /note >}}

## Configure Redis Sentinel

From v2.9.3, Redis Sentinel is supported.

Similar to Redis Cluster, our Gateway, Dashboard, and Pump all support integration with Redis Sentinel.

To configure Tyk to work with Redis Sentinel, list your servers under `addrs` and set the master name in your Gateway, Dashboard, Pump, and MDCB config. Unlike Redis Cluster, `enable_cluster` should **not** be set.  Indicative config snippets as follows:

### Redis Sentinel and Gateway

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

### Redis Sentinel and Dashboard

```json
"redis_addrs": [
  "server1:26379",
  "server2:26379",
  "server3:26379"
],
"redis_master_name": "mymaster"
```

### Redis Sentinel and Pump

```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

{{< warning success >}}
**Warning**

When using Bitnami charts to install Redis Sentinel in Kubernetes (k8s), a Redis service is exposed, which means that the standard Redis configuration is required instead of the above setup. In other words, a single server in `addrs` and `master_name` is not necessary.

{{< /warning >}}

### Support for Redis Sentinel AUTH

To support the use of Redis Sentinel AUTH (introduced in Redis 5.0.1), we have added the following global config settings in Tyk v3.0.2:

* In the Tyk Gateway config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Dashboard config file - `redis_sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Pump config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Identity Broker config file - `SentinelPassword`
* In the Tyk Synk config file - `sentinel_password`

These settings allow you to support Sentinel password-only authentication in Redis version 5.0.1 and above.

See the Redis and Sentinel authentication section of the [Redis Sentinel docs](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) for more details.
