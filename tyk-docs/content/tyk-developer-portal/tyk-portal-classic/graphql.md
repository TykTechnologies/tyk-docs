{{< /warning >}}

As of Tyk v3.0.0, you can now publish GraphQL APIs, including [Universal Data Graph]({{< ref "api-management/data-graph#overview" >}}) APIs(UDG) to the Tyk Developer Portal.

When you do that, your API consumers can navigate through a GraphQL Playground, with an IDE complete with Intellisense.

## Video Walkthrough

We have a YouTube walkthrough of how to publish a GraphQL API to your Developer Portal:

## How To Set Up

Simply create a GraphQL or Universal Data Graph API, create a Policy which protects it, and then publish it to the Developer Portal Catalog.

In the "Create a Catalog" section, at the bottom, make sure you enable the "Display Playground"

And then, when your API consumers are on the Developer Portal Catalog and click on View Documentation, they will be taken to the GraphQL Playground.

## Protected GraphQL Catalog

If you have a protected API, your users won't be able to inspect the GraphQL schema or make API calls until they add their API Key to the Headers section:

## CORS

You may have to enable the following CORS settings in the "Advanced Options" of the API Designer to allow your consumers to access the GraphQL Playground:
