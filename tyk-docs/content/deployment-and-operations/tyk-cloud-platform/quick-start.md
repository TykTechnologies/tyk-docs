Welcome to the Tyk Cloud Platform! 
This guide will lead you through the following steps: 
1. Signing up with Tyk Cloud.
2. Establishing dedicated infrastructure within Tyk Cloud.
3. Creating and securing your first API using the Tyk Dashboard.
No installation required!

## Step 1: Sign Up for Tyk Cloud

To begin your Tyk Cloud journey, follow these simple steps to sign up for an account:

* Navigate to the [Tyk Cloud sign up form](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#cloud).
* Fill in the required information and click on "Next step: Create your password".
* Provide your email address and choose a robust password for your account.
* Select your home region, where your data will be securely stored.
* Opt for the "Set up API platform automatically" option (you can still personalize your setup later).
* Wait a couple of minutes and congratulations, your API platform was deployed!

By default, a cloud data plane will be deployed for you. You can also deploy hybrid data planes on your own infrastructure. 

## Step 2: Get started with your first API with Tyk Dashboard




* Click on "Manage my APIs" to access the Tyk Dashboard directly. If you closed your window in the meantime, follow these steps to reach the Tyk Dashboard in Tyk Cloud:
  * Go to the "Deployments" section under "OPERATIONS" on the left-hand side.
  * Select the control plane that was deployed for you.
  * Click on the "Manage APIs" button under "API MANAGER DASHBOARD" in the "Tyk component links" section to access the Tyk Dashboard.

* Click the "Design new API" button to start the API definition creation process.

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-create-api.png" alt="Accessing Creating an API" width="500px" >}}

* Give your API a name - We’ll use “httpbin” for the rest of this quick start.
* In the "Type" section, please select "HTTP".
* Keep https://httpbin.org/ as the upstream URL.
* Finally, click on the button "CONFIGURE API".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/create-api-tyk-cloud.png" alt="Accessing Creating an API" width="500px" >}}

* Select to which gateway you want to deploy this API, select the "edge" tags to deploy to the cloud data plane.

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-select-cloud-gateway.png" alt="Accessing Creating an API" width="500px" >}}

* Customize your API settings, including authentication, rate limits, and caching, as per your requirements.
* Click "Save" to create your API. Congratulations! You've just set up your first API.

## Step 3: Set up a Policy and Key

In this step, we will guide you through the process of creating a policy and key system to secure your APIs.

#### Create a Policy:

* Click on "Policies" under the "System Management" section on the left-hand side.
* Click on the button "ADD POLICY".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-add-policy.png" alt="Policy section" width="500px" >}}

* In the "Access Rights" section, please select "httpbin".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-policy-access-rights.png" alt="Policy section" width="500px" >}}

* Go to the "Configurations" section and add a Policy Name (e.g., 'Default Policy httpbin').
* Under the "Settings" section, add an expiry date (e.g., '2 weeks').
* Click on the button "Create Policy".
{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-policy-configurations.png" alt="Policy section" width="500px" >}}

#### Create a Key:

* Click on "Keys" under the "System Management" section on the left-hand side.
* Click on the button "ADD KEY".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-add-key.png" alt="Key section" width="500px" >}}

* In the "Access Rights" section, please select the previously created Policy (e.g., 'Default Policy httpbin').

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-key-access-rights.png" alt="Key section" width="500px" >}}

* Go to the "Configurations" section and give your key an alias (e.g., 'platform_team').
* Click on the button "Create Key".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-key-configurations.png" alt="Key section" width="500px" >}}

Congratulations! Your key has now been created!

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-copy-key-url.png" alt="Key section" width="500px" >}}

<b>Note:</b> Please copy the "Key ID" as it will be necessary when testing the API.

Now that your API is created, you can explore and manage it through the Tyk Dashboard.

## Step 4: Send a test API request to the secured endpoint

#### Postman

After creating a Policy and a Key, proceed to "Postman" to test and interact with the API you've just created.

* Click on "APIs" under the "System Management" section on the left-hand side.
* Select the previously created API (e.g., 'httpbin').
* Copy the API URL.

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-copy-api-url.png" alt="API section" width="500px" >}}

* In Postman, choose "Send an API request".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-postman-send-api-request.png" alt="Postman section" width="500px" >}}

* Enter the copied URL and add "https://" at the beginning.

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-postman-enter-url.png" alt="Postman section" width="500px" >}}

* In the Tyk Gateway Dashboard, navigate to "Keys" under the "System Management" section on the left-hand side.
* Copy the previously created "Key ID".

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-copy-key-url.png" alt="Key section" width="500px" >}}

* On Postman, navigate to the "Authorization" tab.
* Change the authentication type from "Inherit auth from parent" to "API Key".
* Paste the "Key ID" into the "Value" field.
* Click the "Send" button to submit the request.

{{< img src="/img/cloud/tyk-cloud-postman-authorization.png" alt="Key section" width="500px" >}}

#### Curl

To test and interact with the API, you can also use the curl command:

```
curl -X GET "${API URL}" -H "Authorization: ${KEY ID}"
```

**Example:** 

```
'curl -X GET "https://corporate-bakery-gw.aws-euw2.cloud-ara.tyk.io/httpbin/" -H "Authorization: eyJvcmciOiI2NWIxMmYxMWJkZjg0YTAwMDEzY2UzZDkiLCJpZCI6IjRmYzM2OTc4NDg1MzQ3NzRiMDhhZ
mEyNTVkNzIxM2NkIiwiaCI6Im11cm11cjEyOCJ9"'
```
