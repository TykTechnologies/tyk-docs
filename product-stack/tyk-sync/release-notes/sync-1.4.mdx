#### Breaking Changes
This release has no breaking changes.

#### Deprecations
There are no deprecations in this release.

#### Release Highlights
This release works with Tyk Dashboard and Tyk Gateway v5.3.0.

<h4 id="Changelog-v1.4.3">Changelog</h4>
##### Updated

<ul>
<li>
<Expandable title={'API definitions supported up to Tyk Gateway v5.3.0'}>
Tyk Sync supports both Tyk OAS APIs and Tyk Classic APIs when working with Tyk Dashboard. However, to use Tyk Sync to migrate Tyk OAS APIs you would need to set a special config field in Tyk Dashboard and an argument for Tyk Sync. This is a temporary measure provided for early adopters and will be **deprecated** later when Tyk Sync is updated in a future release to bring you the full Tyk OAS API experience as soon as possible.

Recommended usage:
Tyk Dashboard setting: [allow-unsafe-oas](/tyk-dashboard/configuration#allow_unsafe_oas)
Tyk Sync: use the [--allow-unsafe-oas](/api-management/automations#synchronize-tyk-environment-with-github-repository) when invoking the CLI

###### API Category is not yet supported
API Categories are a new capability with v5.3.0 of Tyk Dashboard. API Categories are currently not supported in Tyk Sync for Tyk OAS APIs. This means that Tyk Sync will not be able to save the category definition set for the Tyk OAS API. Until we update Tyk Sync you would need to manually recreate the categories in the new environment.
