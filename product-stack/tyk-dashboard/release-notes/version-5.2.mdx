#### Fixed

<ul>
 <li>
 <AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Poor experience when using the Open Policy Agent (OPA) editor'}>
Fixed two UI issues with the [OPA editor](/tyk-dashboard/open-policy-agent#using-the-open-policy-agent-in-the-dashboard) in the Tyk Dashboard to improve experience when using this feature. Scrolling beyond the end of the OPA window does not now start to scroll the API Designer window, and minimizing then re-expanding the OPA editor no longer limits the text to one line.

Fixed minor issues in the Dashboard UI when configuring the user access controls for the Identity Management (TIB) and Real Time Notifications permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Unable to select Mutual TLS version 1.3 from the API Designer dropdown'}>
Fixed an issue where TLS 1.3 was not offered as an option in the "Minimum TLS version" dropdown in the API Designer. Also we gave better (human readable) names to the options, like TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 etc. instead of their corresponding numbers 769, 770 etc.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Tyk Dashboard panic when using mongo-go driver'}>
Fixed a situation where Tyk Dashboard could panic when using the mongo-go driver.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Confusing error message if user tries to modify Tyk OAS API using a Tyk Classic API endpoint/summary>\n\n Improved the error message that is returned when user tries to update a Tyk OAS API using a Tyk Classic API endpoint when `allow_unsafe_oas` is not enabled.\n \n \n\n\n#### Added\n\n\n \n \n Implemented a `tyk version` command that provides more details about the Tyk Dashboard build'}>

<h3 id="Changelog-v5.2.3">Changelog</h3>
#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Unable to resize OPA editor in Tyk Dashboard'}>
Fixed an issue where the [OPA editor](/tyk-dashboard/open-policy-agent#using-the-open-policy-agent-in-the-dashboard) was not resizable. The fix ensures the floating OPA editor is now resizable and the resizing operation is smooth, improving user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'User Search not working unless you enter the full email address'}>
Fixed an issue where the [User Search](/basic-config-and-security/security/dashboard/search-users) was not working unless the full email address was entered. The fix restores the functionality of showing suggestions for names as they are typed in, improving user experience and search efficiency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dashboard 4.1.0+ cannot retrieve certificates from downrev gateways'}>
Fixed an issue where Dashboard 4.1.0+ was unable to retrieve certificates from a Tyk Gateway with a version lower than 4.1.0. This was due to a change made in the 4.1 versions relating to the way certificate details are retrieved in the dashboard; in the newer versions, we can view more details of the certificates. Now you can use Tyk Dashboard with any version of the Tyk Gateway and still retrieve and view certificate details; the fix ensures smooth staged upgrades and prevents potential issues for customers who have weeks or months between upgrading components.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Authentication Mode changes after changing API Protocol in API Designer'}>
Fixed an issue in the Tyk Classic API Designer where if you changed the protocol for an API (for example from HTTP to HTTPS) then the authentication mechanism would be automatically set to Authentication Token.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Unable to configure external OAuth flow using Raw API editor'}>
Fixed an issue in the Classic API Designer where the 'use_standard_auth' value was constantly reverting to 'true' when editing an API with an [external OAuth flow](/basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/ext-oauth-middleware). This fix ensures the 'use_standard_auth' value remains consistent, enabling the use of external OAuth via the Raw API editor.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'If the GraphQL subscription upstream disconnects, the UI is unaware of the reconnection event'}>
Fixed an issue with failed GraphQL subscriptions between the upstream and the Dashboard. When an upstream subscription was disconnected and later reconnected, the UI did not update to reflect the reconnection, preventing the seamless consumption of messages. Now the Dashboard can continue consuming messages after upstream reconnects.

<h3 id="Changelog-v5.2.2">Changelog</h3>
#### Added

<ul>
<li>
<Expandable title={'Added new Dashboard configuration option `allow_unsafe_oas`'}>
Added a new Dashboard configuration option `allow_unsafe_oas`. This permits the modification of Tyk OAS APIs via the Tyk Classic API endpoints. This is not a recommended action due to the risk of inconsistent behavior and potential for breaking changes while Tyk OAS is in [Early Access](/developer-support/special-releases-and-features/early-access-features). This is provided for early adopters and will be deprecated later, once Tyk OAS reaches full maturity.
</summary>
</Expandable>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<ul>
<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Fixed security policy grant permissions issue encountered with MongoDB'}>
Fixed an issue when using MongoDB and [Tyk Security Policies](/getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy) where Tyk could incorrectly grant access to an API after that API had been deleted from the associated policy. This was due to the policy cleaning operation that is triggered when an API is deleted from a policy in a MongoDB installation. With this fix, the policy cleaning operation will not remove the final (deleted) API from the policy; Tyk recognizes that the API record is invalid and denies granting access rights to the key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'User might not correctly inherit all permissions from their user group'}>
Fixed an issue in the Tyk Dashboard where a user might not correctly inherit all permissions from their user group, and could incorrectly be granted visibility of Identity Management.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Tyk would not store Policy ID in the API Definition for a policy that did not exist'}>
Fixed an issue where Tyk would not store the *Policy Id* in the *API Definition* for a policy that did not exist. When using *JWT Authentication*, the *JWT Default Policy Id* is stored in the *API Definition*. If this policy had not been created in Tyk at the time the *API Definition* was created, Tyk Dashboard would invalidate the field in the *API Definition*. When the policy was later created, there would be no reference to it from the *API Definition*. This was a particular issue when using *Tyk Operator* to manage the creation of assets on Tyk.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Service Uptime page did not report the number of success hits correctly'}>
Fixed an issue in the Dashboard *Service Uptime* page where the number of success hits was being incorrectly reported as the total number of hits, inclusive of failures. After this fix, the *Success Column* displays only the number of success hits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'High priority CVEs fixed'}>
Fixed the following high priority CVEs identified in the Tyk Dashboard, providing increased protection against security vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2022-33082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33082)
- [CVE-2022-28946](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28946)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Azure SAML2.0 Identity Provider was preventing users from authenticating'}>
Fixed an issue encountered with *Azure SAML2.0 Identity Provider* that was preventing users from authenticating.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Fields defined in Uptime_Tests.Check_List were not correctly handled in API Designer'}>
Fixed an issue encountered with the *API Designer* where fields defined in *Uptime_Tests.Check_List* were not correctly handled. Uptime tests can now be configured for *Tyk Classic APIs* using the *Raw API Definition* editor.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Tyk Dashboard API security vulnerability'}>
Fixed a security vulnerability with the Tyk Dashboard API where the `api_version` and `api_id` query parameters were potential targets for SQL injection attack.

#### Updated

<ul>
<li>
<Expandable title={"Renamed License Limit to License Entitlement on Tyk Dashboard's Licensing Statistics screen"}>
On Tyk Dashboard's Licensing Statistics screen, we have renamed the License Limit to License Entitlement. We've also improved the experience when there is no limit in the license by hiding the License Entitlement line if no limit is set.

### Release Highlights

We're thrilled to bring you some exciting enhancements and crucial fixes to improve your experience with Tyk Dashboard. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog](#Changelog-v5.2.0) below.

Configure Caching Timeouts Per API Endpoint and Enable Advanced Caching Options From Within Dashboard

We’ve added the ability to [configure](/basic-config-and-security/reduce-latency/caching/advanced-cache#advanced-caching-by-endpoint) per-endpoint timeouts for Tyk’s response cache, giving you increased flexibility to tailor your APIs to your upstream services. While doing this, we’ve also fixed a longstanding issue within the *Tyk Dashboard* so that you can configure more of the [advanced caching](/basic-config-and-security/reduce-latency/caching/advanced-cache#configuring-endpoint-caching-in-the-dashboard) options from within the UI.

#### Added Body Transform Middleware to Tyk OAS API Definition

With this release, we are adding the much requested *Body Transformations* to *Tyk OAS API Definition*. You can now [configure](/tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#transformbody) middleware for both [request](/transform-traffic/request-body) and [response](/advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/response-body) *Body Transformations* and - as a *Tyk Dashboard* user - you’ll be able to do so from within our simple and elegant API Designer tool. Visually test and preview *Body Transformations* from within the API Designer.

#### Track Usage Of License APIs, Gateways And Distributed Data Planes Over Time

Within the Dashboard UI, we’ve enhanced the *Licensing* information page, so that you can visualise your usage of licensed APIs, *Gateways* and distributed *Data Planes* over time. This allows the visualisation of deployed and active APIs using a range of different types of interactive charts.

</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Advanced cache config data was absent in the Raw Editor'}>
Fixed an issue where *advanced_cache_config* data was absent in the *Raw Editor*. This fix now ensures that *advanced_cache_config* can be configured. Furthermore, API modifications in the *Designer* no longer lead to data loss, safeguarding cache configuration consistency. The UI now offers a clear view of advanced cache settings, including the new *Timeout* field and *Cache* response codes fields.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'403 errors were raised with JWT claim names containing spaces'}>
Fixed an issue with *JWT claim names* containing spaces. Previously 403 errors were raised when using tokens containing such claims.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Popular endpoints were not displayed in Tyk Dashboard when SQL aggregated analytics was enabled'}>

Fixed a potential security vulnerability where *static* or *dynamic mTLS* requests with expired certificates could be proxied upstream.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Users were unable to view request analytics for a specific date in the API Activity dashboard'}>
Fixed an issue in the *API Activity* dashboard where users were unable to view request analytics for a specific date. Subsequently, users can now make informed decisions based on access to this data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Enforced timeout configuration parameter for an API endpoint was not validated'}>
Fixed an issue where the [Enforced Timeout](/planning-for-production/ensure-high-availability/enforced-timeouts) configuration parameter of an API endpoint accepted negative values, without displaying validation errors.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Duplicate APIs could be created when click save button multiple times in API Designer'}>
Fixed an issue in *Tyk Dashboard* where duplicate APIs could be created with the same names and listen paths if you clicked multiple times on the *save* button in the API Designer. Now, this is not possible anymore and there is no risk of creating multiple APIs with the same name.
</li>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Connection issues were encountered with MongoDB connection strings'}>
Fixed an issue with *MongoDB* connection strings. To ensure consistent compatibility with both *mgo* and *mongo-go* drivers, users should now utilize URL-encoded values within the *MongoDB* connection string's username and password fields when they contain characters like "?", "@". This resolves the need for different handling across *MongoDB* drivers.
