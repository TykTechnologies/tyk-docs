## 2.0.0 Release Notes

##### Release Date 26 September 2024

#### Breaking Changes

#### 1. URL Path Matching Configuration Changes

Tyk Charts v2.0 introduces a **breaking change** related to URL path matching behavior in the Tyk Gateway. If you are using Tyk Gateway versions 5.0.14 (2023 LTS), 5.3.5 (2024 LTS), or 5.5.1 (latest feature branch) or above, two new configuration options have been added to the Gateway:

- `http_server_options.enable_path_prefix_matching`
- `http_server_options.enable_path_suffix_matching`

These options allow more restrictive URL path matching by controlling whether the request path matches the start or end of the specified pattern. If both are set to `true`, Tyk enforces "exact" path matching. By default, these options are set to `false` in the Gateway to avoid breaking existing configurations.

However, starting with **Tyk Charts v2.0**, these options will be set to `true` by default, enforcing stricter security by requiring precise path matches. This change applies to new installations or upgrades via Tyk Charts v2.0 and above.

From this version of Tyk Charts we also set the following configuration option to `true` by default as part of the stricter path matching:

- `http_server_options.enable_strict_routes`

**Impact on existing users:**

- The change is **backward-compatible** for users upgrading their Tyk Gateway directly (i.e. not via Helm Chart), because by default, these features will not be active. This ensures that existing configurations are not affected if you update the Gateway manually.
- However, **if you install or upgrade via Tyk Charts v2.0**, these options will be set to `true` by default. This means stricter URL path matching will be enforced automatically, which could impact your existing routes or configurations if you're not prepared for it. Please ensure you understand and test these new configurations before upgrading your production environment.

**Action required:**

- Familiarize yourself with URL matching in Tyk [here](/getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching).
- For production setup guidance, see [this guide](/planning-for-production#ensure-you-are-matching-only-the-url-paths-that-you-want-to-match).
- Configure the new options via the Helm chart, and test the changes in a non-production environment before upgrading.

#### 2. Default Tyk Component Versions

This release changes the default component versions in Tyk Charts v2.0 to **Long-Term Support (LTS)** versions for greater stability in production environments. The new defaults are:

|Tyk Component|Default Version|Customization Parameter|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|Tyk Gateway|5.3.5 LTS|`--set tyk-gateway.gateway.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Dashboard|5.3.5 LTS|`--set tyk-dashboard.dashboard.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Pump|1.11.0|`--set tyk-pump.pump.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk MDCB|2.7.0|`--set tyk-mdcb.mdcb.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Developer Portal|1.10.0|`--set tyk-dev-portal.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Operator|0.18.0|`--set tyk-operator.image.tag=<desired-version>`|

If you need to use a different version for any component, adjust the Helm chart parameters during installation or upgrade.

<ul>

<li>
<Expandable title={'Support for New Path Matching Configuration Options'}>
Tyk Charts v2.0 introduces support for the newly added Tyk Gateway configuration options: `enable_path_prefix_matching` and `enable_path_suffix_matching`. These settings allow more secure and explicit URL matching by restricting path pattern matching to the start or end of the request path. This enhancement benefits customers who need more precise route matching to ensure that only intended paths are matched in production environments, reducing the risk of unintentional routing.

URL path matching mode is configurable using these `tyk-gateway` chart parameters:

- `gateway.enablePathPrefixMatching` (default to `true`)
- `gateway.enablePathSuffixMatching` (default to `true`)
- `gateway.enableStrictRoutes` (default to `true`)

Learn more about the settings in the [URL Path Matching](/getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching) documentation.
</Expandable>
</li>

<li>
<Expandable title={'Configuration for Extra Volume Mounts in Tyk-Bootstrap'}>
This release adds support for `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` parameters in the `tyk-bootstrap` charts, enabling users to mount additional volumes. This is especially useful for users with custom storage or configuration needs in their deployments, offering more flexibility in managing their Tyk installation.

The options are configurable using these `tyk-bootstrap` chart's parameters:

- `bootstrap.extraVolumes` (default to empty list)
- `bootstrap.extraVolumeMounts` (default to empty list)
</Expandable>
</li>

</ul>

{/* ##### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:

- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?

##### Changed

<ul>

<li>
<Expandable title={'Default to Long-Term Support (LTS) Versions for Components'}>
Tyk Charts v2.0 now defaults to Long-Term Support (LTS) versions for Tyk Gateway and Tyk Dashboard. This change ensures greater stability and long-term support for customers deploying Tyk in production environments, reducing the risk of issues due to feature branch releases. Users can still override these versions if needed, but the default will provide a more predictable upgrade path for most use cases.
</Expandable>
</li>

</ul>

{/* #### Security Fixes
This section should be a bullet point list that should be included when any security fixes have been made in the release, e.g. CVEs. For CVE fixes, consideration needs to be made as follows:
1. Dependency-tracked CVEs - External-tracked CVEs should be included on the release note.
2. Internal scanned CVEs - Refer to the relevant engineering and delivery policy.

For agreed CVE security fixes, provide a link to the corresponding entry on the NIST website. For example:

- Fixed the following CVEs:
    - [CVE-2022-33082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33082) */}

{/* Required. use 3 hyphens --- between release notes of every patch (minors will be on a separate page) */}
