## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

The Tyk Developer Portal Management API offers programmatic
access to all portal resources that your instance of the portal manages.
This API repeats functionality of the user interface and enables APIs
consumers integrating their portal instances with their other IT systems
such as billings, CRMs, ITSM systems and other software.


## Authentication

This API requires an admin authorisation token that is available for admin
users of the portal in the profile page.
