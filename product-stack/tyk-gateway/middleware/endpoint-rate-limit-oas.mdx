The per-endpoint rate limit middleware allows you to enforce rate limits on specific endpoints. This middleware is configured in the [Tyk OAS API Definition](/tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#operation), either via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you’re using the legacy Tyk Classic APIs, then check out the [Tyk Classic](/product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/endpoint-rate-limit-classic) page.

## Configuring a rate limit in the Tyk OAS API Definition

The design of the Tyk OAS API Definition takes advantage of the
`operationId` defined in the OpenAPI Document that declares both the path
and method for which the middleware should be added. Endpoint `paths`
entries (and the associated `operationId`) can contain wildcards in the
form of any string bracketed by curly braces, for example
`/status/{code}`. These wildcards are so they are human-readable and do
not translate to variable names. Under the hood, a wildcard translates to
the “match everything” regex of: `(.*)`.

The rate limit middleware (`rateLimit`) can be added to the `operations` section of the
Tyk OAS Extension (`x-tyk-api-gateway`) in your Tyk OAS API Definition
for the appropriate `operationId` (as configured in the `paths` section
of your OpenAPI Document).

The `rateLimit` object has the following configuration:

- `enabled`: enable the middleware for the endpoint
- `rate`: the maximum number of requests that will be permitted during the interval (window)
- `per`: the length of the interval (window) in time duration notation (e.g. 10s)

#### Simple endpoint rate limit

For example:

```json {hl_lines=["39-43"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-rate-limit",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/status/200": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "status/200get",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-rate-limit",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-rate-limit/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "status/200get": {
                    "rateLimit": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "rate": 60,
                        "per": "1s"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a rate limit has been configured for the `GET
/status/200` endpoint, limiting requests to 60 per second.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition
that you can import into Tyk to try out the Per-endpoint Rate Limiter
middleware.

#### Advanced endpoint rate limit

For more complex scenarios, you can configure rate limits for multiple
paths. The order of evaluation matches the order that endpoints are
defined in the `paths` section of the OpenAPI description. For example,
if you wanted to limit the rate of `POST` requests to your API allowing a
higher rate to one specific endpoint you could configure the API
definition as follows: 

```json {hl_lines=["49-53", "56-60"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "advanced-rate-limit",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/user/login": {
            "post": {
                "operationId": "user/loginpost",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "/{any}": {
            "post": {
                "operationId": "anypost",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "advanced-rate-limit",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/advanced-rate-limit/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "user/loginpost": {
                    "rateLimit": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "rate": 100,
                        "per": "1s"
                    }
                },
                "anypost": {
                    "rateLimit": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "rate": 60,
                        "per": "1s"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the first rule limits requests to the `POST /user/login`
endpoint to 100 requests per second (rps). Any other `POST` request to an
endpoint path that matches the regex pattern `/{any}` will be limited to
60 rps. The order of evaluation ensures that the specific `POST
/user/login` endpoint is matched and evaluated before the regex pattern.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition
that you can import into Tyk to try out the Per-endpoint Rate Limiter
middleware.

## Configuring the middleware in the API Designer

Configuring per-endpoint rate limits for your API endpoints is easy when using the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint

From the **API Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path and method to which you want to apply the middleware.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-endpoints.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no endpoints created" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-add-endpoint.png" alt="Adding an endpoint to an API using the Tyk OAS API Designer" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-middleware.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no middleware enabled on endpoint" />

#### Step 2: Select the Rate Limit middleware

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** and choose **Rate Limit** from the *Add Middleware* screen.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-rate-limit.png" alt="Adding the Rate Limit middleware" />

#### Step 3: Configure the middleware

You must provide the path to the compiled plugin and the name of the Go function that should be invoked by Tyk Gateway when the middleware is triggered.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-rate-limit-config.png" alt="Configuring the per-endpoint custom plugin" />

#### Step 4: Save the API

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** to save the middleware configuration. Remember to select **SAVE API** to apply the changes.
