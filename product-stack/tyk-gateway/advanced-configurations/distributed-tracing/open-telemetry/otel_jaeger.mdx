This quick start guide offers a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for configuring Tyk API Gateway (OSS, self-managed or hybrid gateway connected to Tyk Cloud) with OpenTelemetry and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) to significantly improve API observability. We will cover the installation of essential components, their configuration, and the process of ensuring seamless integration.

For Kubernetes instructions, please refer to [How to integrate with Jaeger on Kubernetes](/product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/otel_jaeger_k8s).

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

- [Docker installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Gateway v5.2.0 or higher

## Step 1: Create the Docker-Compose File for Jaeger

Save the following YAML configuration in a file named docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  # Jaeger: Distributed Tracing System
  jaeger-all-in-one:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    ports:
      - "16686:16686" # Jaeger UI
      - "4317:4317" # OTLP receiver
```

This configuration sets up Jaeger's all-in-one instance with ports exposed for Jaeger UI and the OTLP receiver.

## Step 2: Deploy a Test API Definition

If you haven't configured any APIs yet, follow these steps:

- Create a subdirectory named apps in the current directory.
- Create a new file named `apidef-hello-world.json`.
- Copy the provided simple API definition below into the `apidef-hello-world.json` file:


```json
{ 
    "name": "Hello-World",
    "slug": "hello-world",
    "api_id": "Hello-World",
    "org_id": "1",
    "use_keyless": true,
    "detailed_tracing": true,
    "version_data": {
      "not_versioned": true,
      "versions": {
        "Default": {
          "name": "Default",
          "use_extended_paths": true
        }
      }
    },
    "proxy": {
      "listen_path": "/hello-world/",
      "target_url": "http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/",
      "strip_listen_path": true
    },
    "active": true
}
```

This API definition sets up a basic API named Hello-World for testing purposes, configured to proxy requests to `http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/`.

## Step 3: Run Tyk Gateway OSS with OpenTelemetry Enabled

To run Tyk Gateway with OpenTelemetry integration, extend the previous Docker Compose file to include Tyk Gateway and Redis services. Follow these steps:

- Add the following configuration to your existing docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
# ... Existing docker-compose.yml content for jaeger

tyk:
  image: tykio/tyk-gateway:v5.2.0
  ports:
    - 8080:8080
  environment:
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER=grpc
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=jaeger-all-in-one:4317
  volumes:
    - ${TYK_APPS:-./apps}:/opt/tyk-gateway/apps
  depends_on:
    - redis

redis:
  image: redis:4.0-alpine
  ports:
    - 6379:6379
  command: redis-server --appendonly yes
```

- Navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file in your terminal.
- Execute the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Step 4: Explore OpenTelemetry Traces in Jaeger

- Start by sending a few requests to the API endpoint configured in Step 2:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/hello-world/ -i
```

- Access Jaeger at *http://localhost:16686*.
- In Jaeger's interface:
  - Select the service named tyk-gateway.
  - Click the *Find Traces* button.

You should observe traces generated by Tyk Gateway, showcasing the distributed tracing information.
