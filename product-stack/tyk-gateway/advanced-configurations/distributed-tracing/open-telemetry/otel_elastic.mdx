This quick start explains how to configure Tyk API Gateway (OSS, self-managed or hybrid gateway connected to Tyk Cloud) with the OpenTelemetry Collector to export distributed traces to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/observability).

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

* Tyk Gateway v5.2 or higher
* OpenTelemetry Collector deployed locally
* Elasticsearch deployed locally or an account on Elastic Cloud with Elastic APM

Elastic Observability natively supports OpenTelemetry and its OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to ingest traces, metrics, and logs.

## Step 1: Configure Tyk API Gateway

To enable OpenTelemetry in Tyk API Gateway, follow these steps:

For Tyk Helm Charts:
* Add the following configuration to the Tyk Gateway section:

```yaml
tyk-gateway:
  gateway:
    opentelemetry:
      enabled: true
      endpoint: {{Add your endpoint here}}
      exporter: grpc
```

For Docker Compose:
* In your docker-compose.yml file for Tyk Gateway, add the following environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
  - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER=grpc
  - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT={{Add your endpoint here}}
```

Make sure to replace `{{Add your endpoint here}}` with the appropriate endpoint from your OpenTelemetry collector.

After enabling OpenTelemetry at the Gateway level, you can activate [detailed tracing](/product-stack/tyk-gateway/advanced-configurations/distributed-tracing/open-telemetry/open-telemetry-overview) for specific APIs by editing their respective API definitions. Set the `detailed_tracing` option to either true or false. By default, this setting is false.

## Step 2: Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to Export to Elasticsearch

To configure the OTel Collector with Elasticsearch Cloud, follow these steps:

* Sign up for an [Elastic account](https://www.elastic.co/) if you haven't already
* Once logged in to your Elastic account, select "Observability" and click on the option "Monitor my application performance"

* Scroll down to the APM Agents section and click on the OpenTelemetry tab

<img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-02.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" />

* Search for the section "Configure OpenTelemetry in your application". You will need to copy the value of "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT" and "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS" in your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file.

* Update your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration, here's a simple example:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 # OpenTelemetry receiver endpoint
processors:
  batch:
exporters:
 otlp/elastic:
    endpoint: "ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_ENDPOINT_GOES_HERE" #exclude scheme, e.g. HTTPS:// or HTTP://
    headers:
      # Elastic APM Server secret token
      Authorization: "Bearer ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlp/elastic]
```

If are running Elasticsearch locally, you will need to use your APM Server endpoint (elastic-apm-server:8200) and set-up [a secret token authorization in ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/secret-token.html).

You can refer to the [example configuration provided by Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/open-telemetry-direct.html#connect-open-telemetry-collector) for more guidance on the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.

## Step 3: Explore OpenTelemetry Traces in Elasticsearch

* In Elasticsearch Cloud:
  * Go to "Home" and select "Observability."
  <img src="/img/distributed-tracing/opentelemetry/elastic-configure-otel-04.png" alt="Configure Elasticsearch" />
  * On the right menu, click on "APM / Services."
  * Click on "tyk-gateway."

You will see a dashboard automatically generated based on the distributed traces sent by Tyk API Gateway to Elasticsearch.
