## Tutorial: Add an API and Swagger based Docs to a Portal Catalog

You can use the Tyk Dashboard to create a portal that allows developers to access the APIs you create.

### Prerequisites for a portal catalog entry:

- An API configured and live on your Tyk Gateway
- The API must be **Closed** (i.e. it must use either Auth Token or Basic Auth security mechanisms)
- A security policy configured to grant access to the API




    <Note>
    If you intend to use the developer portal, you need to configure it with a different hostname to your dashboard. The developer portal cannot be accessed via an IP address.
    </Note>



<Warning>
Without these prerequisites, you may get a 404 error when trying to access the portal.
</Warning>



### Step 1: Select "Catalog" from the "Portal Management" section

### Step 2: Click ADD NEW API

This page displays all of the catalog entries you have defined, whether they have documentation attached and whether they are active on the portal or not. Click **ADD NEW API**.

## Add API Details

### Step 3: Show the API

By default your entry will be published automatically to your Portal Catalog. Deselect this option to not publish it.

### Step 4: Set a Public API Name and associate a security policy

When publishing an API with Tyk, you are not publishing a single API, but instead you are publishing access to a group of APIs. The reason for this is to ensure that it is possible to compose and bundle APIs that are managed into APIs that are published. Tyk treats these as separate, so the thing that is published on the portal is not the same as the actual API being managed by Tyk, one is a logical managed API and the other (the published catalog version) is a facade.

Since API policies allow the bundling of access control lists of multiple APIs, it is actually this that you are granting access to. Any developer that signs up for this API, will be granted a bearer token that has this policy as a baseline template, or as a "plan".

Please note:

1.  You will only see security policies for valid APIs in the **Public API Name** drop-down list for the policies
2.  The **Available policies** selected must be "closed" (see Prerequisites)

### Step 5: Add a description

All catalog entries can have a description. You can use Markdown formatting in these fields:

<img src="/img/2.10/catalogue_description.png" alt="Description" />

You can also add an email address if you require notification that an API subscription has been submitted or granted. We'll leave that blank for this tutorial. The same goes for Custom Fields. See [Custom Portal](/tyk-developer-portal/tyk-portal-classic/customise/custom-developer-portal#updating-a-developer-example-adding-custom-fields) for an example of a Custom Field implementation.


### Step 6: Attach Documentation

You can add import documentation in the following formats:

- From a Swagger JSON file (OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 are supported)
- From a Swagger URL
- From API Blueprint



    <Note>
    Support for API Blueprint is being deprecated. See [Importing APIs](/api-management/gateway-config-managing-classic#api-blueprint-is-being-deprecated) for more details.
    </Note>


You can add your documentation before or after saving your API.

### Settings Options

We are not going to do anything with these options for this tutorial. For more information:

* See [OAuth Clients](/tyk-developer-portal/tyk-portal-classic/portal-oauth-clients) for details of using OAuth with your catalog entry.
* See [Portal Customization](/tyk-developer-portal/customise)for details about redirection of key requests and developer signup customization.

### Step 6: Save the API

To save the API, click **SAVE**.

### Step 7: Take a look

You can now visit your portal to see the API catalog entry. Select **Open Your Portal** from the **Your Developer Portal** menu:
