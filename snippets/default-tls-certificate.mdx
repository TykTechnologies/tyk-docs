*Default TLS Certificate*

The Gateway Helm chart ships with a default self-signed TLS certificate for quick evaluation and testing purposes. This certificate is automatically used when you enable TLS via `global.tls.gateway` without providing your own certificate.

<Warning>
The default certificate is self-signed and intended only for development and testing purposes. For production deployments, you should always use your own trusted certificate.
</Warning>

*Transitioning to the New Default Certificate*

Tyk periodically renews the default self-signed certificate shipped with the Helm charts. To ensure backward compatibility during transitions, the chart supports serving both the legacy and the new certificate simultaneously. This allows clients to continue connecting while you update their trust stores.

To enable the new default certificate alongside the legacy one:

```yaml
tyk-gateway:
  gateway:
    tls:
      useNewDefaultCertificate: true
```

When `useNewDefaultCertificate` is set to `true`:
- Both the legacy and the new certificates are loaded by the Gateway
- Clients can connect using either certificate during the transition period
- After updating client trust stores, the legacy certificate will be removed in a future release

<Note>
This option is only relevant if you are using the default Tyk certificate (`useDefaultTykCertificate: true`). If you provide your own certificate via `secretName`, this setting has no effect.
