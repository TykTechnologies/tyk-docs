## Introduction

You can set up Tyk Cloud to use a custom domain. Using custom domains is available on our free trial and all our paid [plans](https://tyk.io/price-comparison/). You can use a custom domain for both your **Control Planes** and **Cloud Data Planes**.


<Note>

Wild cards are not supported by Tyk Cloud in custom domain certificates
</Note>


## Custom Domains with Control Planes

* Currently, you can only use **one custom domain** per Control Plane deployment.
* The custom domain in this case ties to a **Tyk Developer Portal**. Please set up a **CNAME DNS** record such that it points to the "Portal" ingress as displayed on your Control Plane deployment page.
  
## Custom Domains with Cloud Data Planes

You can set multiple custom domains on a Cloud Data Plane. In this instance please set up your CNAME DNS records such that they point to the only ingress displayed on your Cloud Data Plane deployment page.

Note: While you can set multiple custom domains for a Cloud Data Plane, a single custom domain cannot be used for multiple Cloud Data Planes.

## How to set up a Custom Domain

In this example we are going to set up a custom domain called `Cloud Data Plane.corp.com` for a Cloud Data Plane deployment.

1. Create a CNAME DNS record `edge.corp.com` that points to your Cloud Data Plane ingress (e.g. `something-something.aws-euw2.cloud-ara.tyk.io`).
2. From your Cloud Data Plane deployment, select **Edit** from the Status drop-down.

3. Enter `edge.corp.com` in the Custom Domains field.

4. Click **Save and Re-deploy**.

## How our Custom Domain functionality works

When you point your custom domain to your deployment, we use [Let\'s Encrypt\'s](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge) **HTTP01 ACME**  challenge type, which verifies ownership by accessing your custom CNAME on your Control Plane or Cloud Data Plane deployment. For example - `something-something.aws-euw2.cloud-ara.tyk.io` above.
