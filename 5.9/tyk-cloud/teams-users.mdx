1. From the Admin > Teams screen, click **Add Team**.
2. Enter a name for the new team that will be added to the organization.

## Managing Users

The following [user roles](/5.9/tyk-cloud/teams-users#user-roles-within-tyk-cloud) can perform existing User Admin tasks:

* [Organization Admin](/5.9/tyk-cloud/teams-users#assign-user-roles) - Can manage all users in the organization they are a member of.
* [Team Admin](/5.9/tyk-cloud/teams-users#assign-user-roles) - Can only manage the users of the team they are a member of.



    <Note>
    Organization Admins, Team Admins and Team Members are responsible for managing the Tyk Cloud organization hierarchy and deploying/managing stacks, as well as having access to the Tyk Dashboard to manage APIs. Users of Tyk Cloud are usually DevOps, Architects and sometimes Engineers or Managers.

    You can also [add users to the Tyk Dashboard](/5.9/api-management/user-management#manage-tyk-dashboard-users) itself instead of inviting them as Tyk Cloud users. These users would likely be your API Developers and Engineers who manage the APIs.

### Initial Tyk Cloud Account Roles

The user who signs up for the initial Tyk Cloud account is uniquely assigned to two roles:

1. Org admin of the organization
2. Billing admin of the account

This is the only occasion where a user can be assigned to 2 roles. So, for example, if you invite a user to be a Team Admin, that is the only role (and team) they can belong to. For a user to be invited as a Billing admin, they can't have an existing Tyk Cloud account.


<Note>
This functionality may change in subsequent releases.

**Tyk System Integration User (do not delete)**

When you click your Control Plane Dashboard link from your Tyk Cloud Deployments Overview screen, you are automatically logged in to your Dashboard. This is due to a default Tyk Integration user that is created as part of the Control Plane deployment process. This user has a first name of `Tyk System Integration` and a last name of `User (do not delete)`. As the last name infers, you should not delete this user or your access to the Dashboard will be broken from your Tyk Cloud Installation.
