## Kubernetes Demo

The [tyk-k8s-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo) repository allows you to start up an entire Tyk Stack
with all its dependencies as well as other tools that can integrate with Tyk.
The repository will spin up everything in Kubernetes using `helm` and bash magic
to get you started.

**Purpose**
Minimize the amount of effort needed to start up the Tyk infrastructure and
show examples of how Tyk can be set up in k8s using different deployment
architectures as well as different integrations.

### Prerequisites

#### Required Packages

You will need the following tools to be able to run this project.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - CLI tool for controlling Kubernetes clusters
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - Helps manage Kubernetes applications through Helm charts
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) - CLI for working with JSON output and manipulating it 
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - CLI used to obtain the project from GitHub
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (only when using `--cloud` flag)

Tested on Linux/Unix based systems on AMD64 and ARM architectures

#### License Requirements
- **Tyk OSS**: No license required as it is open-source.

- **Licensed Products**: Sign up [here](https://tyk.io/sign-up) using the button below, and choose "Get in touch" to receive a guided evaluation of the Tyk Dashboard and your temporary license. 
<ButtonLeft href="https://tyk.io/sign-up#self" color="green" content="Get started" />


**How to use the license key**

Once you obtained the license key, create a `.env` file using the [example provided](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/blob/main/.env.example) and update it with your licenses as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo.git
cd tyk-k8s-demo
cp .env.example .env
```

Depending on the deployments you would like to install set values of the `LICENSE`, `MDCB_LICENSE`, and `PORTAL_LICENSE`
inside the `.env` file.

#### Minikube
If you are deploying this demo on [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start), 
you will need to enable the [ingress addon](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/#enable-the-ingress-controller). 
You can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### Quick Start
```bash
./up.sh --deployments portal,operator-httpbin tyk-stack
```
This quick start command will start up the entire Tyk stack along with the
Tyk Enterprise Portal, Tyk Operator, and httpbin CRD example.

### Possible deployments
- `tyk-stack`: A comprehensive Tyk Self Managed setup for a single region
- `tyk-cp`: Tyk control plane in a multi-region Tyk deployment
- `tyk-dp`: Data plane of hybrid gateways that connect to either Tyk Cloud or a Tyk Control Plane, facilitating scalable deployments
- `tyk-gateway`: Open Source Software (OSS) version of Tyk, self-managed and suitable for single-region deployments

If you are running a POC and would like an example of how to integrate a
specific tool, you are welcome to submit a [feature request](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/issues/new/choose)

**Example**
```bash
./up.sh \
  --storage postgres \
  --deployments prometheus-grafana,k6-slo-traffic \
  tyk-stack
```

The deployment process takes approximately 10 minutes, as the installation is sequential and some dependencies take 
time to initialize. Once the installation is complete, the script will output a list of all the services that were 
started, along with instructions on how to access them. Afterward, the k6 job will begin running in the background, 
generating traffic for 15 minutes. To monitor live traffic, you can use the credentials provided by the script to 
access Grafana or the Tyk Dashboard

### Bash Script Usage
<br />

#### Start Tyk deployment
Create and start up the deployments

```bash
Usage:
  ./up.sh [flags] [command]

Available Commands:
  tyk-stack
  tyk-cp
  tyk-dp
  tyk-gateway

Flags:
  -v, --verbose         bool     set log level to debug
      --dry-run         bool     set the execution mode to dry run. This will dump the kubectl and helm commands rather than execute them
  -n, --namespace       string   namespace the tyk stack will be installed in, defaults to 'tyk'
  -f, --flavor          enum     k8s environment flavor. This option can be set 'openshift' and defaults to 'vanilla'
  -e, --expose          enum     set this option to 'port-forward' to expose the services as port-forwards or to 'load-balancer' to expose the services as load balancers or 'ingress' which exposes services as a k8s ingress object
  -r, --redis           enum     the redis mode that tyk stack will use. This option can be set 'redis', 'redis-sentinel' and defaults to 'redis-cluster'
  -s, --storage         enum     database the tyk stack will use. This option can be set 'mongo' (amd only) and defaults to 'postgres'
  -d, --deployments     string   comma separated list of deployments to launch
  -c, --cloud           enum     stand up k8s infrastructure in 'aws', 'gcp' or 'azure'. This will require Terraform and the CLIs associate with the cloud of choice
  -l, --ssl             bool     enable ssl on deployments
```

#### Stop Tyk deployment
Shutdown deployment

```bash
Usage:
  ./down.sh [flags]

Flags:
  -v, --verbose         bool     set log level to debug
  -n, --namespace       string   namespace the tyk stack will be installed in, defaults to 'tyk'
  -p, --ports           bool     disconnect port connections only
  -c, --cloud           enum     tear down k8s cluster stood up
```

**Clusters**
You can get the repository to create demo clusters for you on AWS, GCP, or Azure. That can be set using the `--cloud` flag
and requires the respective cloud CLI to be installed and authorized on your system. You will also need to specify the
`CLUSTER_LOCATION`, `CLUSTER_MACHINE_TYPE`, `CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT`, and `GCP_PROJECT` (for GCP only) parameters in the .env file.

You can find examples of .env files here:
- [AWS](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/tree/main/src/clouds/aws/.env.example)
- [GCP](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/tree/main/src/clouds/gcp/.env.example)
- [Azure](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/tree/main/src/clouds/azure/.env.example)

For more information about cloud CLIs:
- AWS:
  - [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- GCP:
  - [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)
  - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable per [documentation from Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)
- Azure:
  - [az](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### Customization
This repository can also act as a guide to help you get set up with Tyk. If you just want to know how to set up a specific
tool with Tyk, you can run the repository with the `--dry-run` and `--verbose` flags. This will output all the commands that
the repository will run to stand up any installation. This can help debug as well as figure out what
configuration options are required to set these tools up.

Furthermore, you can also add any Tyk environment variables to your `.env` file and those variables will be mapped to
their respective Tyk deployments.

Example:
```env
...
TYK_MDCB_SYNCWORKER_ENABLED=true
TYK_MDCB_SYNCWORKER_HASHKEYS=true
TYK_GW_SLAVEOPTIONS_SYNCHRONISERENABLED=true
```

### Variables
The script has defaults for minimal settings in [this env file](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/tree/main/.env.example),
and it will give errors if something is missing.
You can also add or change any Tyk environment variables in the `.env` file,
and they will be mapped to the respective `extraEnvs` section in the helm charts.

## Docker Compose Setup

### Who is this page for?
This is the guide we recommend for a easy quick start. The instructions are the ones shared with you when you register to a [free trial](https://tyk.io/sign-up/).

You can also use this guide for your PoC since it spins up a full Tyk Self Managed stack for you using our project *Docker Pro Demo*, however, if you are interested in learning Tyk, there's an option for [Tyk Demo](/5.9/deployment-and-operations/tyk-self-managed/tyk-demos-and-pocs/overview) which is a project that spins up full Tyk stack that includes a prepopulate API definitions of all kinds, with various middleware options and can also spin up supporting tools such as Prometheus, Keycloak (IDP) etc.

### What's included?
The *Tyk Pro Docker Demo* is our [Self-Managed](/5.9/tyk-self-managed) solution, which includes our Gateway, Dashboard, and analytics processing pipeline. This demo will run Tyk Self-Managed on your machine, which contains 5 containers: Tyk Gateway, Tyk Dashboard, Tyk Pump, Redis and MongoDB. This demo is great for proof of concept and demo purposes, but if you want to test performance, you will need to move each component to a separate machine.


<Warning>
This demo is NOT intended for production use or performance testing, since it uses docker compose and the configuration files are not specifically tuned for performance testing or high loads. Please visit the [Planning for Production](/5.9/planning-for-production) page to learn how to configure settings for optimal performance.
</Warning>


<Note>
The Tyk Pro Docker demo does not provide access to the [Developer Portal](/5.9/portal/overview/intro).
</Note>
