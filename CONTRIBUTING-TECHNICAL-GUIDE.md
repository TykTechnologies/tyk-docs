# Tyk Documentation

Contains the [Tyk Documentation](https://tyk.io/docs/) source.

## How To Contribute?

Using Github GUI in the browser or local dev env, this is the question!

### 1. GitHub GUI Browser
Contributing to the docs via the browser is fast and easy. 
GH provides great DX for making updates, committing and creating PRs via the browser. The DX for reviewing PRs is also pretty powerful.

#### When To Use it?
Use GitHub GUI browser when you:
- Have simple and only a few edits of the markdown files. 
- Already know the syntax for adding internal links and adding images. 
- Already know what you are going to write and you **don't** need many iterative commits to see if the result looks okay. In this case, using a local environment will be much faster (explain in the next section)

#### How To Use It?
Will briefly explain it as it is quite trivial:
1. Via the GUI you can simply click the pencil icon to start editing, then check the differences, click commit to commit the changes to a new branch, and eventually create a PR. 
2. Check that the CI jobs started running. These jobs run tests on the website including your changes. Running CI jobs are displayed in yellow. 
3. Once the CI job finishes it will turn green. Upon completion, you will see a preview link that you should use to check your changes on a real deployment of the Tyk docs website.


### 2. Local Development Environment
Local environment means, checking out the tyk-docs repo and updating the files using an editor or an IDE. This allows you to test the changes by running Hugo locally and check for errors in Hugo or in the website Hugo generated.

#### When To Use It?
Using the browser is not always enough and you sometimes need to check out the repo and work locally.
You normally favor using a local environment when you need to:
- Test things yourself before you push them
- Repeatedly push changes and test the website

Doing so by **running Hugo locally will save you a lot of time** since it takes the CI a few minutes to update the deployment with the latest changes and finish its test before it becomes green. 

#### Use Cases For Local Development Environment
When you need to:
- Test things yourself before you push them
- Check that the image you added work
- See how images are rendered on the page
- Check that the internal links you added work
- Are not sure about the syntax of links or images when you work on many pages
- When adding new files, it's easier to run it locally since you cannot be sure of the internal links format and may need to validate referenced links to other content pages and sections

#### How To Use It?

For internal Tyklings the recommended way to contribute is from a pull request branch in the [tyk-docs](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs) repository.

For external contributions, we recommend contributing to Tyk in the following way:

- Fork this repository
- Clone the forked repository on your machine
- Create a remote branch, e.g `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs.git`
- Fetch from the remote branch `git fetch upstream`
- Rebase your branch with the latest remote branch content `git rebase upstream/master`

## Installing Hugo

### Run Hugo With Docker
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Run `docker-compose up` from the project directory

### Run Hugo Locally
1. Install [Hugo v0.110.0+extended or greater](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. Run `hugo server --theme=tykio --buildDrafts --enableGitInfo` from the `tyk-docs/tyk-docs` directory
3. Go to  [http://localhost:1313/docs/nightly/](http://localhost:1313/docs/nightly/) to view the docs locally
4. The content itself is just markdown that follows the front matter block. After making a change, Hugo should auto-reload and you will be able to see the changes live in your browser. If not, refresh. Sometimes Hugo gets confused and you may need to re-run it

## Getting Started

This section briefly explains how to work with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) to create content in the Tyk Docs repository.

To get started:
1. Clone this repository 
2. Navigate to the project directory

The docs content lives in `tyk-docs/content`.

### Adding A New Section And/Or A New Page

1. Add a new folder within the `tyk-docs/tyk-docs/content` directory. For example `new-section`.
2. Within the root folder of the repository, create a markdown file using the `hugo new` command from your terminal. For the above example you would run `hugo new --configDir tyk-docs new-section/new-section.md`. This file will be converted to the equivalent of an `index.html` file.
3. You can then create other markdown files within that directory, that you can name as you want.

![readme-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1983518/36219727-457c16f4-11b0-11e8-9839-946ef00c4655.png)

### Front Matter

For each new file created via `hugo new`, the following YAML formatted [Front Matter](http://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) is added:

```markdown
---
title: "New Section"
date: 2024-07-31
tags: ["example-tag1", "example-tag2"]
description: "Enter a brief description of the section here."
---

**Insert Lead paragraph here.**
```

- `title` is taken from the name of the markdown file created
- `date` is auto populated in a year-month-day format
- `tags` are used to create meta keywords in the HTML output, and are added in the following format - `tags: ["tag 1", "tag 2", "tag 3"]`
- `description` is used for the meta description in the HTML output

Example front matter for a page:

```markdown
---
title: "Test"
date: 2021-02-10
tags: ["Tyk", "advanced-configuration", "Dashboard"]
description: "Testing the description and tagging functionality in Tyk"
---
```

### Links

All links should be defined using the `ref` function. This ensures that links will be correct and will never break docs.

As an added value, you can specify the file path relative to the "content" folder. However, because our URL structure is synced with the file structure, it will be the same as the URL path.

Example:

```
[Link title]({{< ref "tyk-open-source" >}})
```

### Images

All images should be uploaded to `assets/img` folder (do not confuse it with `static/img`).

All images should be defined using `img` tag.
Example:

```
{{< img src="/img/docker.png" alt="Docker" width="500px" >}}
```

`src` and `alt` parameters are required for images.

## Using Shortcodes

Various shortcodes are used within the Tyk documentation to facilitate writing content.

### Grid Shortcode

You can find 3 sizes of grid layouts. This is used in conjunction with the badge shortcode

1. grid
2. mid
3. big

#### Grid

```
{{< grid >}}

Content goes here

{{< /grid >}}
```

#### Mid

```
{{< grid type="mid" >}}

Content goes here

{{< /grid >}}
```

#### Big

```
{{< grid type="big">}}

Content goes here

{{< /grid >}}
```

### Badge

The badge shortcode can be used in differing ways to populate the 3 grid types. We have used these on the default docs [landing page](https://tyk.io/docs/) and the [Tyk Cloud landing page](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-cloud). The examples are from the default landing page.

## The Pipeline

When you create a PR in this repository:

### 1. The CI pipeline will run tests (Hugo and Netlify).
   <img width="864" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3155222/221001455-a196c09f-55d9-4c50-acc2-4ae7c5fd6343.png">

### 2. Netlify will create a version of the website from your PR and provide you with a link:

- Don't forget to add `/docs/nightly` to the URL.
  <img width="948" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3155222/221002201-5b0c8d49-8cc3-497c-b188-ffafa63b57f9.png">

### 3. Verifying your changes in the Netlify build:

**For Contributors Outside Tyk:** A Tyk team member will need to approve the Netlify CI build for your pull request (PR). You will need to wait 
until the CI status is green.

**Locating Your Changes:** Since there’s no search feature in this Netlify build, you can find your changes by following these steps:
	1.	Copy the file path: From the file path in GitHub, copy the portion after `/content` up to the end, excluding the `.md` file extension.
	2.	Construct the URL: Append this copied path to the Netlify URL after `/docs/nightly`.
	3.	Example: To see the document at tyk-docs GitHub repository, copy `/tyk-self-managed/install` (omit `.md`) and add it after /docs/nightly/ in the Netlify URL, resulting in [https://deploy-preview-2330--tyk-docs.netlify.app/docs/nightly/tyk-self-managed/install/](https://deploy-preview-2330--tyk-docs.netlify.app/docs/nightly/tyk-self-managed/install/).
