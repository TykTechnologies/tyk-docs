## Introduction

The following [user roles](/5.5/tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md) can perform existing User Admin tasks:

* [Organization Admin](/5.5/tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md#user-roles-within-tyk-cloud) - Can manage all users in the organization they are a member of.
* [Team Admin](/5.5/tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md#user-roles-within-tyk-cloud) - Can only manage the users of the team they are a member of.



    <Note>
    Organization Admins, Team Admins and Team Members are responsible for managing the Tyk Cloud organization hierarchy and deploying/managing stacks, as well as having access to the Tyk Dashboard to manage APIs. Users of Tyk Cloud are usually DevOps, Architects and sometimes Engineers or Managers.

    You can also [add users to the Tyk Dashboard](/5.5/basic-config-and-security/security/dashboard/create-users) itself instead of inviting them as Tyk Cloud users. These users would likely be your API Developers and Engineers who manage the APIs.
