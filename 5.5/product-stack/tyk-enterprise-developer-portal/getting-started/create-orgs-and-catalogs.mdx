## Introduction

In the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal, Organizations and Catalogs are used to segment the user base and make different APIs available to different user audiences according to the business model.
For example, assume the following scenario:

- Account Management API is available only to trusted partners
- Payment API is available to all developers

Subsequently, two catalogs can be created for these two APIs.

In the below example, an API Provider offers two API Products (the Accounts API and Payment API) with two plans (the Free plan and Enterprise plan) to their customers.
Customers subscribed to the enterprise plan can use both APIs, offering a higher user limit. Conversely, customers subscribed to the Free plan (individual developers or hobbyists) only have visibility of the Payment API.

To achieve that, the API Provider uses two catalogs to implement their business model so that they can offer different experiences for different customer audiences. This section explains how to achieve that using the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal.

## Create organization and teams
The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal uses Organization and Catalogs to segment access to APIs and plans. Therefore, the first thing is to create an organization for your customers. If you don't want to provision organizations manually, you can leverage the [Admin APIs](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/api-documentation/tyk-edp-api.md) or enable the [self-service organization registration](/5.5/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-api-consumer-organisations.md).
In this guide, we will create the **B2B customer** organization to fulfill the above business model:
1. To create an organization for the **B2B customer**, navigate to the **Organizations** menu and click on the **Add new organization** button.

2. Enter the name of your new organization and click on the **Save** button. A new default-team will be automatically created and associated with your new organization.

<Note>
You can edit the default team name by navigating to **Teams** and opening up the team associated with the organization you created. This will allow you to edit the team name as required.

## Create catalogs
1. To create catalogs, navigate to the catalogs menu in the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal.

The default catalogs that are featured when the portal is [bootstrapped](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/bootstrapping-portal.md) are:
- **Public** catalogs are available to all developers.
- **Private** catalogs are available only to logged in developers who have been assigned with access.

You can create new catalogs by clicking on the **Add new catalog** button or use the default catalogs.

2. To add a new catalog, click on the **Add new catalog** button. Then specify the name of the catalog and select its type: **Private** or **Public**.
   Since the public catalog already exists, in this guide you need to create only an additional private catalog called **Enterprise catalog** for the **B2B customer** who will have extended access rights compared to other developers.

<Note>
While it is possible to create multiple public catalogs, we do not advise doing so. This is because multiple public catalogs will share the same level of access.

3. Once the catalog is created, add a developer audience to it by clicking on the **Add Team** button and selecting an appropriate developer team (**B2B customer All users** in this example).
   Finally, add plans and API Products to the created catalog so that the selected developer teams can view them.
   <img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/add-team-products-and-plans.png" alt="Add teams, products, and plans to the catalogue" />

You can achieve the same result by navigating to the **API Products** menu. Adding an API Product to a catalog through the **Catalogs** and the **API Products** menus will produce the same result.

<Note>
**Congratulations**

You have successfully added a catalog and associated a team with it. Furthermore, you have allocated plans and API products to this catalog.
