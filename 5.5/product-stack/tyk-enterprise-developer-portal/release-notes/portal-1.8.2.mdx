## Release Highlights
The 1.8.2 release addresses multiple high-priority bugs:
- Fixed the bug where an API Consumer could add incompatible products to a cart making its state inconsistent.
- Fixed the bug where it was possible to use the same session cookie from different IP addresses making the portal vulnerable to the [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery).
- Fixed the bug where an admin user couldn't create a new team in Kubernetes environment.
- Fixed the bug where the navigation in the API documentation was broken when Redoc is selected as a documentation rendering engine.
- Fixed the bug where an API Consumer could bypass the access request rate limit by creating additional applications.
- Fixed the bug where the page rendering fails if the page refers to a template that has no template/layout pair definition in the theme manifest.
- Fixed the bug where creating new content blocks in non-default themes led to duplication of those content blocks in the admin UI.
- Fixed the bug where `.Markdown` content blocks where not shown.
