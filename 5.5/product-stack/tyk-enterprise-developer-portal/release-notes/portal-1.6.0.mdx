## Release Highlights
#### OAuth2.0 flow now supports multiple identity providers
Now the Tyk Enterprise Developer portal can use multiple identity providers (IdPs) for OAuth2.0 via the Dynamic Client Registration flow. If your company has multiple OAuth2.0 providers now you can utilize them all for OAuth2.0 authentication. For instance, if your company uses different IdPs for different products (e.g. one for the U.S. and another for the EU) you can now achieve that with Tyk.

Just create multiple IdPs in the App registration menu:

And then use them to enable OAuth2.0 authentication for API Products:
<img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.6.0-multiple-idps-edit.png" alt="OAuth2.0 provider overview" />

#### New Admin API for all content-blocks 
You can download all CMS content with just one API call with the brand new API endpoint *GET* */pages/all/content-blocks* that returns all content blocks for all pages. Now migration between environments and deployment is much easier.

#### Support for Mutual TLS
For customers who need extra security for their APIs such financial institutions and payment providers we introduced an ability for the portal to surface Mutual TLS APIs. Now you can configure API Key and OAuth2.0 API to support Mutual TLS. Just create an API that supports multiple authentication mechanisms in the Dashboard and publish it to the portal:
<img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.6.0-mtl-support-dashboard.png" alt="Mutual TLS auth API in the Tyk Dashboard" />

Now your developers can discover and request access to them in the portal:
<img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.6.0-mtl-support-published.png" alt="Mutual TLS auth API Product is published in the portal" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.6.0-mtl-support-checkout.png" alt="Mutual TLS auth API Product in the checkout flow" />

#### Display-only support for API Products with custom authentication
This new capability allows you to display on the portal the APIs that use your own custom authentication mechanisms. We appreciate that many customer use their own auth mechanisms and even though at the moment we cannot create credentials for custom authentication schemas, we still want to support customers using these.

To display API Products that support custom authentication, you need simply to create an API Product that include APIs with custom authentication and synchronize it to the portal:

## Changelog

#### Added
- Added support for multiple IdPs of the OAuth2.0 flow. If a customer has multiple OAuth2.0 providers now they can utilize them all for OAuth2.0 authentication with Tyk.
- Added new admins APIs for querying all content-blocks to improve data migration capabilities of the portal. 
- Added support for API Products that use Mutual TLS. Now API Providers can surface their API Products that use Mutual TLS authentication on the portal and developer can request access to them.
- Added display-only support for API Products with custom authentication. This allows API Providers to expose on the portal their APIs that use custom authentication for documentation purposes. 

#### Changed
- Simplified the connection settings to the portal assets storage (where all images, themes, and other CMS files are stored) to help our customers get up to speed quicker. We are well aware that installing and configuring on-premise software can be tricky, especially when it comes to infrastructure, storage and databases. Hence, we have decided to ease this burden for you:
  - By default, the portal uses the `db` [storage type](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration#portal_storage) for storing its themes and other CMS assets and it doesn’t require any additional configuration. This means, you can start the portal right away without specifying any additional setting for the assets storage.
  - We also simplified setting up S3 storage: now you need only to configure connection settings to the bucket and the portal will handle the rest.


#### Fixed
- In 1.6.0 multiple important security bugs are fixed:
  - Added the ability to disable the theme upload capability. Since we don’t validate the theme content it might have viruses and other malicious software. So, to provide super secure environments, we added a setting to disable the theme upload via the UI and API:
    <img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.6.0-theme-upload-is-disabled.png" alt="Mutual TLS auth API Product in the checkout flow" />
  - Fixed the bug where the session is not invalidated after a user logs out.
  - Fixed the role permission issue where a provider-admin can deactivate and delete a super-admin.
  - Fixed the Users API resource which allowed any value to be entered into the Provider and Role fields.
- In addition to the security fixes, several bugs related to the theme management are fixed:
  - The list of available templates is now automatically updated when a new theme is loaded.
 - Fixed the bug where theme unpacking required unnecessary write permission to the */tmp* folder.
  - Fixed icon alignment in the UI on the main page of the default theme.
