**Licensed Protected Product**

##### Release Date 27 Apr 2024

#### Breaking Changes
This release has no breaking changes.

#### Future breaking changes
In 2.0.0 release (the next after the next release) we will introduce the capability to create products and plans in the portal instead of creating policies for products and plans in the dashboard.

To achieve that, we will need to change the plans and products architecture. The main change is that plans will include access rights to APIs and endpoint.

As a result of this, 2.0.0 won't be backwards compatible with the previous versions. We will provide migration scripts and instructions before that release.

#### Deprecations
There are no deprecations in this release.

## Release Highlights
The 1.9.0 release addresses several security vulnerability and bugs and introduces two new capabilities:
- [Webhooks](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/portal-customisation/configure-webhooks.md) for events that happen in the portal.
- [Admin APIs](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/api-documentation/tyk-edp-api) for OAuth2.0 configuration. 

#### Upgrade instructions
If you are on 1.8.5 or an older version we advise you to upgrade ASAP directly to this release.

This release doesn't introduce any changes to the theme, so a theme upgrade is not required.

## Changelog
#### Added
- Added [the webhooks](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/portal-customisation/configure-webhooks.md) capability that  enable real-time, automated data updates between the portal and 3rd party applications.
