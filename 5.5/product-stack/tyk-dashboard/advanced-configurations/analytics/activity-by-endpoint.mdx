To get a tabular view of how your API traffic is performing at the endpoint level, you can select the Activity by Endpoint option in the navigation and see a tabular view of your API endpoints. This table will list your API endpoints by their traffic volume and you’ll be able to see when they were last accessed:

## Controlling which endpoints appear in the analytics data

The aggregate pumps have an option to `track_all_paths` which will ensure that all analytics records generated by the Tyk Gateway will be included in the aggregated statistics on the Endpoint Popularity screen. Set this to `true` to capture all endpoints in the aggregated data and subsequently on the Dashboard page.

You can alternatively select only a subset of the endpoints to include in the aggregated data by setting `track_all_paths` to `false` and identifying specific endpoints to be "tracked". These are identified by the `TrackPath` [flag](/5.5/tyk-stack/tyk-pump/tyk-analytics-record-fields#trackpath) being set to `true` in the record. In this configuration, the Pump will only include transaction records from "tracked" endpoints in the aggregated data.

Tyk Gateway will set `TrackPath` to `true` in transaction records generated for endpoints that have the track endpoint middleware enabled.


<Note>
The *track endpoint* middleware only affects the inclusion of endpoints in the per-endpoint aggregates, it does not have any impact on other [aggregated data](/5.5/tyk-dashboard-analytics#aggregated-analytics) nor the [per-request data](/5.5/tyk-dashboard-analytics#per-request-raw-analytics).

## Selecting Tyk OAS APIs endpoints to be tracked

The design of the Tyk OAS API Definition takes advantage of the `operationId` defined in the OpenAPI Document that declares both the path and method for which the middleware should be added. The `path` can contain wildcards in the form of any string bracketed by curly braces, for example `{user_id}`. These wildcards are so they are human readable and do not translate to variable names. Under the hood, a wildcard translates to the “match everything” regex of: `(.*)`.

The track endpoint middleware (`trackEndpoint`) can be added to the `operations` section of the Tyk OAS Extension (`x-tyk-api-gateway`) in your Tyk OAS API Definition for the appropriate `operationId` (as configured in the `paths` section of your OpenAPI Document).

The `trackEndpoint` object has the following configuration:
 - `enabled`: enable the middleware for the endpoint

For example:
```json {hl_lines=["39-41"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-track-endpoint",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/anything": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "anythingget",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-track-endpoint",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-track-endpoint/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "anythingget": {
                    "trackEndpoint": {
                        "enabled": true
                    }               
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example the track endpoint middleware has been configured for requests to the `GET /anything` endpoint. These requests will appear in the Endpoint Popularity analytics screen, located within the API Usage section of Tyk Dashboard.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition that you can import into Tyk to try out the track endpoint middleware.

### Configuring the middleware in the API Designer

Adding the track endpoint middleware to your API endpoints is easy when using the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

##### Step 1: Add an endpoint

From the **API Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path and method to which you want to apply the middleware.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-endpoints.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no endpoints created" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-add-endpoint.png" alt="Adding an endpoint to an API using the Tyk OAS API Designer" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-middleware.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no middleware enabled on endpoint" />

##### Step 2: Select the Track Endpoint middleware

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** and choose the **Track Endpoint** middleware from the *Add Middleware* screen.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-track.png" alt="Adding the Track Endpoint middleware" />

##### Step 3: Save the API

Select **SAVE API** to apply the changes to your API.

## Selecting Tyk Classic API endpoints to be tracked 
If you are working with Tyk Classic APIs then you must add a new `track_endpoints` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition.

The `track_endpoints` object has the following configuration:
- `path`: the endpoint path
- `method`: the endpoint HTTP method

For example:
```.json  {linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "extended_paths": {
        "track_endpoints": [
            {
                "disabled": false,
                "path": "/anything",
                "method": "GET",
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example the track endpoint middleware has been configured for HTTP `GET` requests to the `/anything` endpoint.  These requests will appear in the Endpoint Popularity analytics screen, located within the API Usage section of Tyk Dashboard.

### Configuring the middleware in the API Designer

You can use the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard to configure the track endpoint middleware for your Tyk Classic API by following these steps.

##### Step 1: Add an endpoint for the path and select the plugin

From the **Endpoint Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path for which you want to allow access. Select the **Track endpoint** plugin.

<img src="/img/dashboard/analytics/classic_track_endpoint.png" alt="Select the middleware" />

##### Step 2: Save the API

Use the *save* or *create* buttons to save the changes and activate the middleware for the selected endpoint.
