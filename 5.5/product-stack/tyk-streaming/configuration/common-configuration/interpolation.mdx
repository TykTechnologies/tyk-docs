Tyk Streams allows you to dynamically set config fields using [Bloblang](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-streaming/guides/bloblang/overview) queries.

## Bloblang Queries

```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ "TODO:6379" ]
    topic: 'meow-${! json("topic") }'
```

A message with the contents `{"topic":"foo","message":"hello world"}` would be routed to the Kafka topic `meow-foo`.

If a literal string is required that matches this pattern (`${!foo}`) then you can escape it with double brackets. For example, the string `${{!foo}}` would be read as the literal `${!foo}`.

[Bloblang](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-streaming/guides/bloblang/overview) supports arithmetic, boolean operators, coalesce and mapping expressions. 

## Examples

### Reference Metadata

A common usecase for interpolated functions is dynamic routing at the output level using metadata:

```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ TODO ]
    topic: ${! meta("output_topic") }
    key: ${! meta("key") }
```

### Coalesce and Mapping

Bloblang supports coalesce and mapping, which makes it easy to extract values from slightly varying data structures:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - cache:
        resource: foocache
        operator: set
        key: '${! json().message.(foo | bar).id }'
        value: '${! content() }'
```

Here's a map of inputs to resulting values:

```
{"foo":{"a":{"baz":"from_a"},"c":{"baz":"from_c"}}} -> from_a
{"foo":{"b":{"baz":"from_b"},"c":{"baz":"from_c"}}} -> from_b
{"foo":{"b":null,"c":{"baz":"from_c"}}}             -> from_c
```

### Delayed Processing

We have a stream of JSON documents each with a unix timestamp field `doc.received_at` which is set when our platform receives it. We wish to only process messages an hour _after_ they were received. We can achieve this by running the `sleep` processor using an interpolation function to calculate the seconds needed to wait for:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - sleep:
      duration: '${! 3600 - ( timestamp_unix() - json("doc.created_at").number() ) }s'
```

If the calculated result is less than or equal to zero the processor does not sleep at all. If the value of `doc.created_at` is a string then our method `.number()` will attempt to parse it into a number.
