Timestamp manipulation methods in Bloblang facilitate precise handling of timestamps, enabling operations such as parsing, formatting, duration calculations and timezone conversions. These methods allow users to parse timestamp strings into standardized formats, perform arithmetic operations with high precision and convert timestamps between different time zones seamlessly. Additionally, they support formatting timestamps with up to nanosecond precision and offer compatibility with ISO 8601 and strftime formats.

## parse_duration

Attempts to parse a string as a duration and returns an integer of nanoseconds. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with an optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

#### Examples


```coffee
root.delay_for_ns = this.delay_for.parse_duration()

# In:  {"delay_for":"50us"}
# Out: {"delay_for_ns":50000}
```

```coffee
root.delay_for_s = this.delay_for.parse_duration() / 1000000000

# In:  {"delay_for":"2h"}
# Out: {"delay_for_s":7200}
```

## parse_duration_iso8601

Attempts to parse a string using ISO-8601 rules as a duration and returns an integer of nanoseconds. A duration string is represented by the format "P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S" or "P[n]W". In these representations, the "[n]" is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the "[n]". For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds". The last field of the format allows fractions with one decimal place, so "P3.5S" will return 3500000000ns. Any additional decimals will be truncated.

#### Examples


Arbitrary ISO-8601 duration string to nanoseconds:

```coffee
root.delay_for_ns = this.delay_for.parse_duration_iso8601()

# In:  {"delay_for":"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S"}
# Out: {"delay_for_ns":110839937000000000}
```

Two hours ISO-8601 duration string to seconds:

```coffee
root.delay_for_s = this.delay_for.parse_duration_iso8601() / 1000000000

# In:  {"delay_for":"PT2H"}
# Out: {"delay_for_s":7200}
```

Two and a half seconds ISO-8601 duration string to seconds:

```coffee
root.delay_for_s = this.delay_for.parse_duration_iso8601() / 1000000000

# In:  {"delay_for":"PT2.5S"}
# Out: {"delay_for_s":2.5}
```

## ts_add_iso8601

Parse parameter string as ISO 8601 period and add it to value with high precision for units larger than an hour.

#### Parameters

**duration** &lt;string&gt; Duration in ISO 8601 format  

## ts_format

Attempts to format a timestamp value as a string according to a specified format, or RFC 3339 by default. Timestamp values can either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in RFC 3339 format.

The output format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006, would be displayed if it were the value. For an alternative way to specify formats check out the [ts_strftime](/5.5/#ts_strftime) method.

#### Parameters

**format** &lt;string, default `"2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00"`&gt; The output format to use.  
**tz** &lt;(optional) string&gt; An optional timezone to use, otherwise the timezone of the input string is used, or in the case of unix timestamps the local timezone is used.  

#### Examples

```coffee
root.something_at = (this.created_at + 300).ts_format()
```

An optional string argument can be used in order to specify the output format of the timestamp. The format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006, would be displayed if it were the value.

```coffee
root.something_at = (this.created_at + 300).ts_format("2006-Jan-02 15:04:05")
```

A second optional string argument can also be used in order to specify a timezone, otherwise the timezone of the input string is used, or in the case of unix timestamps the local timezone is used.

```coffee
root.something_at = this.created_at.ts_format(format: "2006-Jan-02 15:04:05", tz: "UTC")

# In:  {"created_at":1597405526}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:45:26"}

# In:  {"created_at":"2020-08-14T11:50:26.371Z"}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:50:26"}
```

And `ts_format` supports up to nanosecond precision with floating point timestamp values.

```coffee
root.something_at = this.created_at.ts_format("2006-Jan-02 15:04:05.999999", "UTC")

# In:  {"created_at":1597405526.123456}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:45:26.123456"}

# In:  {"created_at":"2020-08-14T11:50:26.371Z"}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:50:26.371"}
```

## ts_parse

Attempts to parse a string as a timestamp following a specified format and outputs a timestamp, which can then be fed into methods such as [ts_format](/5.5/#ts_format).

The input format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be *Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006*, would be displayed if it were the value. For an alternative way to specify formats check out the [ts_strptime](/5.5/#ts_strptime) method.

#### Parameters

**format** &lt;string&gt; The format of the target string.  

#### Examples


```coffee
root.doc.timestamp = this.doc.timestamp.ts_parse("2006-Jan-02")

# In:  {"doc":{"timestamp":"2020-Aug-14"}}
# Out: {"doc":{"timestamp":"2020-08-14T00:00:00Z"}}
```

## ts_round

Returns the result of rounding a timestamp to the nearest multiple of the argument duration (nanoseconds). The rounding behavior for halfway values is to round up. Timestamp values can either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in RFC 3339 format. The [ts_parse](/5.5/#ts_parse) method can be used in order to parse different timestamp formats.


#### Parameters

**duration** &lt;integer&gt; A duration measured in nanoseconds to round by.  

#### Examples


Use the method parse_duration to convert a duration string into an integer argument.

```coffee
root.created_at_hour = this.created_at.ts_round("1h".parse_duration())

# In:  {"created_at":"2020-08-14T05:54:23Z"}
# Out: {"created_at_hour":"2020-08-14T06:00:00Z"}
```

## ts_strftime

Attempts to format a timestamp value as a string according to a specified strftime-compatible format. Timestamp values can either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in RFC 3339 format.

#### Parameters

**format** &lt;string&gt; The output format to use.  
**tz** &lt;(optional) string&gt; An optional timezone to use, otherwise the timezone of the input string is used.  

#### Examples


The format consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters (except `%`). All ordinary characters are copied to the output string without modification. Each conversion specification begins with `%` character followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. Please refer to [man 3 strftime](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strftime) for the list of format specifiers.

```coffee
root.something_at = (this.created_at + 300).ts_strftime("%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S")
```

A second optional string argument can also be used in order to specify a timezone, otherwise the timezone of the input string is used, or in the case of unix timestamps the local timezone is used.

```coffee
root.something_at = this.created_at.ts_strftime("%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S", "UTC")

# In:  {"created_at":1597405526}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:45:26"}

# In:  {"created_at":"2020-08-14T11:50:26.371Z"}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:50:26"}
```

As an extension provided by the underlying formatting library, [itchyny/timefmt-go](https://github.com/itchyny/timefmt-go), the `%f` directive is supported for zero-padded microseconds, which originates from Python. Note that E and O modifier characters are not supported.

```coffee
root.something_at = this.created_at.ts_strftime("%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S.%f", "UTC")

# In:  {"created_at":1597405526}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:45:26.000000"}

# In:  {"created_at":"2020-08-14T11:50:26.371Z"}
# Out: {"something_at":"2020-Aug-14 11:50:26.371000"}
```

## ts_strptime

#### Parameters

**t2** &lt;timestamp&gt; The second timestamp to be subtracted from the method target.  

#### Examples

Use the `.abs()` method in order to calculate an absolute duration between two timestamps.

```coffee
root.between = this.started_at.ts_sub("2020-08-14T05:54:23Z").abs()

# In:  {"started_at":"2020-08-13T05:54:23Z"}
# Out: {"between":86400000000000}
```

## ts_sub_iso8601

#### Parameters

**duration** &lt;string&gt; Duration in ISO 8601 format  

## ts_tz

Returns the result of converting a timestamp to a specified timezone. Timestamp values can either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in RFC 3339 format. The [ts_parse](/5.5/#ts_parse) method can be used in order to parse different timestamp formats.

#### Parameters

**tz** &lt;string&gt; The timezone to change to. If set to "UTC" then the timezone will be UTC. If set to "Local" then the local timezone will be used. Otherwise, the argument is taken to be a location name corresponding to a file in the IANA Time Zone database, such as "America/New_York".  

#### Examples

```coffee
root.created_at_utc = this.created_at.ts_tz("UTC")

# In:  {"created_at":"2021-02-03T17:05:06+01:00"}
