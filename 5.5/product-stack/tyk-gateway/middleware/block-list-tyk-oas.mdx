The [block list](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/block-list-middleware) is a feature designed to block access to specific API endpoints. Tyk Gateway rejects all requests made to endpoints with the block list enabled, returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. 

When working with Tyk OAS APIs the middleware is configured in the [Tyk OAS API Definition](/5.5/tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#operation). You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the legacy Tyk Classic APIs, then check out the [Tyk Classic](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/block-list-tyk-classic) page.

## Configuring the block list in the Tyk OAS API Definition

The design of the Tyk OAS API Definition takes advantage of the `operationId` defined in the OpenAPI Document that declares both the path and method for which the middleware should be added. The `path` can contain wildcards in the form of any string bracketed by curly braces, for example `{user_id}`. These wildcards are so they are human readable and do not translate to variable names. Under the hood, a wildcard translates to the “match everything” regex of: `(.*)`.

The block list middleware (`block`) can be added to the `operations` section of the Tyk OAS Extension (`x-tyk-api-gateway`) in your Tyk OAS API Definition for the appropriate `operationId` (as configured in the `paths` section of your OpenAPI Document).

The `block` object has the following configuration:
- `enabled`: enable the middleware for the endpoint
- `ignoreCase`: if set to `true` then the path matching will be case insensitive

For example:
```json {hl_lines=["47-50", "53-56"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-block-list",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/anything": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "anythingget",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            },
            "put": {
                "operationId": "anythingput",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-block-list",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-block-list/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "anythingget": {
                    "block": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "ignoreCase": true
                    }                
                },
                "anythingput": {
                    "block": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "ignoreCase": true
                    }                
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example the block list middleware has been configured for requests to the `GET /anything` and `PUT /anything` endpoints. Requests to these endpoints will be rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`.
Note that the block list has been configured to be case insensitive, so calls to `GET /Anything` will also be blocked.
Note also that the endpoint path has not been terminated with `$`. Requests to, for example, `GET /anything/foobar` will be rejected as the [regular expression pattern match](/5.5/product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/block-list-middleware#endpoint-parsing) will recognize this as `GET /anything`.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition that you can import into Tyk to try out the block list feature.

## Configuring the block list in the API Designer

Adding the block list to your API endpoints is easy is easy when using the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint

From the **API Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path and method to which you want to apply the middleware.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-endpoints.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no endpoints created" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-add-endpoint.png" alt="Adding an endpoint to an API using the Tyk OAS API Designer" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-middleware.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no middleware enabled on endpoint" />

#### Step 2: Select the Block List middleware

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** and choose the **Block List** middleware from the *Add Middleware* screen.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-block.png" alt="Adding the Block List middleware" />

#### Step 3: Optionally configure case-insensitivity

If you want to disable case-sensitivity for the block list, then you must select **EDIT** on the Block List icon.

<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-block-added.png" alt="Block List middleware added to endpoint - click through to edit the config" />

This takes you to the middleware configuration screen where you can alter the case sensitivity setting.
<img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-block-config.png" alt="Configuring case sensitivity for the Block List" />

Select **UPDATE MIDDLEWARE** to apply the change to the middleware configuration.

#### Step 4: Save the API

Select **SAVE API** to apply the changes to your API.
