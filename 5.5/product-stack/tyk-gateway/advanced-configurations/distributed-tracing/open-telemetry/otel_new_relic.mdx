This guide provides a step-by-step procedure to integrate New Relic with Tyk Gateway via the OpenTelemetry Collector. At the end of this guide, you will be able to visualize traces and metrics from your Tyk Gateway on the New Relic console.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [New Relic Account](https://newrelic.com/)
- New Relic API Key
- Gateway v5.2.0 or higher
- OTel Collector [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector)

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Obtain New Relic API Key

1. Navigate to your New Relic Console.

2. Go to `Profile → API keys`.

3. Copy the key labeled as `INGEST-LICENSE`.



    <Note>
    You can follow the [official New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/) for more information.
    </Note>


**Example token:**

```bash

```

### Step 2: Configuration Files

**OTel Collector Configuration YAML**

1. Create a file named `otel-collector-config.yml` under the configs directory.
2. Copy the following template into that file:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
processors:
  batch:
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-STRING>"
    headers:
      api-Key: "<YOUR-NEW-RELIC-API-KEY>"
extensions:
  health_check:
  pprof:
    endpoint: :1888
  zpages:
    endpoint: :55679
service:
  extensions: [pprof, zpages, health_check]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

- Replace `<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-STRING>` with your specific New Relic endpoint (`https://otlp.nr-data.net` for US or `https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net` for EU).
- Replace `<YOUR-NEW-RELIC-API-KEY>` with the API key obtained in Step 1.

**Docker Compose configuration**

1. Create a file named docker-compose.yml at the root level of your project directory.

2. Paste the following code into that file:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest
    volumes:
      - ./otel-collector-config.yml:/etc/otel-collector.yml
    command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector.yml"]
    networks:
      - tyk
    ports:
      - "1888:1888" # pprof extension
      - "13133:13133" # health_check extension
      - "4317:4317" # OTLP gRPC receiver
      - "4318:4318" # OTLP http receiver
      - "55670:55679" # zpages extension

networks:
  tyk:
```


<Note>
Replace the variable fields with the relevant data.
</Note>


### Step 3: Testing and Verifying Traces

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services.

2. Initialize your Tyk environment.

3. Create a simple `httpbin` API using Tyk Dashboard. You can follow the [Tyk Dashboard documentation](/5.5/getting-started/create-api) for more information.

4. Send requests to the API using cURL or Postman.

5. Open New Relic Console.

6. Navigate to `APM & Services → Services - OpenTelemetry → tyk-gateway`.

7. Wait for about 5 minutes for the data to populate.

Traces and graphs should now be visible on your New Relic console.

<Note>
If traces are not showing, try refreshing the New Relic dashboard.
</Note>


### Troubleshooting

- If the traces aren't appearing, double-check your API key and endpoints.
- Ensure that your Tyk Gateway and New Relic are both running and connected.

### Conclusion

You have successfully integrated New Relic with Tyk Gateway via the OpenTelemetry Collector. You can now monitor and trace your APIs directly from the New Relic console.
