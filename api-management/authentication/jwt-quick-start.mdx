In this tutorial, we'll secure a Tyk OAS API using JWT authentication with either Auth0 or Keycloak as the identity provider.

<Note>
If you want to try out JWT Auth without linking up to a third-party IdP then you can skip step 1 and provide the base64 encoded public key for your JWT (in the `source` field rather than configuring `jwksURIs`) in step 3. You'll need to generate a JWT for the request, but otherwise everything stays the same. 

Now back to the tutorial...
</Note>

We'll start by configuring the identity provider, then set up JWT validation in Tyk, create a security policy, configure the API to use the policy, and finally test the secured API with a valid token.

### Prerequisites

- A Tyk installation (Cloud or Self-Managed) with Tyk Dashboard license
- An Auth0 account or Keycloak installation
- An existing Tyk OAS API (see [this tutorial](/api-management/gateway-config-managing-oas#using-tyk-dashboard-api-designer-to-create-an-api))
- Postman, cURL, or another API testing tool

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Configure Your Identity Provider to obtain your JWKS URI**

    The first step is to configure your Identity Provider (IdP) to issue JWTs and provide a JWKS URI that Tyk can use to validate the tokens. Below are instructions for both Auth0 and Keycloak.

    <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Auth0 Setup">

    1. Log in to your Auth0 dashboard
    2. Navigate to Applications > APIs and click Create API
    3. Enter a name and identifier (audience) for your API
    4. Note your Auth0 domain (e.g. `your-tenant.auth0.com`)
    5. Your JWKS URI will be: `https://your-tenant.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Keycloak Setup">

    1. Log in to your Keycloak admin console
    2. Create or select a realm (e.g. `tyk-demo`)
    3. Navigate to Clients and create a new client with:
          - Client ID: `tyk-api-client`
          - Client Protocol: `openid-connect`
          - Access Type: `confidential`
    4. After saving, go to the Installation tab and select "OIDC JSON" format
    5. Your JWKS URI will be: `http://your-keycloak-host/realms/tyk-demo/protocol/openid-connect/certs`

    </Tab>

    </Tabs>

2. **Create a Security Policy**

    1. In the Tyk Dashboard, navigate to **Policies**
    2. Click **Add Policy**
    3. Configure the policy:
          - Name: `JWT Auth Policy`
          - APIs: Select your Tyk OAS API
          - Access Rights: Configure appropriate paths and methods
          - Authentication: Select JWT
          - JWT Scope Claim Name: Enter the JWT claim that contains scopes (e.g. `scope` or `permissions`)
          - Required Scopes: Add any required scopes for access (optional)
    4. Click Create to save your policy

3. **Configure JWT Authentication in Tyk OAS API**

    1. Navigate to APIs and select your API
    2. Click **Edit**
    3. Enable **Authentication** in the **Server** section, select **JSON Web Token (JWT)** as the authentication method
    4. Configure the JWT settings:
          - Token Signing Method: Select `RSA Public Key`
          - Subject identity claim: Set to `sub`
          - JWKS Endpoint: Enter your JWKS URI for your IdP obtained in step 1
          - Policy claim: Set to `pol`
          - Default policy: Select `JWT Auth Policy` (the policy you created previously)
          - Clock Skew (optional): Set to accommodate time differences (e.g. `10`)
          - Authentication Token Location: `header`
          - Header Name: `Authorization`
          - Strip Authorization Data: `Enabled`
    5. Click **Save API**

4. **Test your API**

    1. Obtain a JWT from your IdP
    2. Make a request to your API providing the JWT as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header; Tyk will validate the JWT using the JWKS that it retrieves from your JWKS URI
    3. Observe that the request is successful

    ```bash
        curl -X GET {API URL}  -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
    ```
